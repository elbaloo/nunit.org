NUnit 2.5.2 - Version 2.5.2.9222 - August 10, 2009

Note: This is the last release of NUnit using source code maintained on Sourceforge. 
      The CVS repository there will be kept, but no longer updated. After this 
      release, the source is being maintained on Launchpad at 
      http://launchpad.net/nunit-2.5.

New Features

Framework

* The new SetUICultureAttribute allows setting CurrentUICulture for the duration 
  of a test method, fixture or assembly.

* The TestFixture, TestCase and TestCaseData attributes have been enhanced to 
  allow ignoring an individual fixture instance or test case. Two new named 
  parameters are provided:
    o Ignore may be set to true to ignore an item.
    o IgnoreReason may be set to specify the reason for ignoring the item. If       IgnoreReason is set to a non-empty string, then setting Ignore is optional. 

* Assert.Catch has been added with several overloads. It differs from Assert.Throws 
  in accepting exceptions derived from the one that is specified. Like Assert.Throws, 
  it returns the exception thrown when it succeeds so that further tests can be 
  made on it.

* The Throws syntax has a number of new additions:
    o Throws.TargetInvocationException, Throws.ArgumentException and
      Throws.InvalidOperationException provide a shorter syntax for testing for 
      these common exception types.
    o Throws.InnerException applies any constraints to the InnerException of the
      exception that was thrown rather than to the exception itself.
    o InnerException can also be used in constraint expressions - see the 
      documentation for an example. 

Bug Fixes

* Data from a TestCaseSource in a separate class from the tests is now 
  handled correctly.

* Arguments specified using TestCaseData are now used correctly.

* Comparing the a stream to itself no longer causes an error.

* TimeoutAttribute is now permitted on an assembly as documented.

* Clear All and Clear Failures buttons are now displayed correctly depending 
  on whether Checkboxes are displayed in the Gui.

* The console runner option descriptions have been revised to more clearly 
  indicate what each option does.

* Running special tests that do not use the nunit.framework assembly no 
  longer causes a null reference exception.

* Console Runner option descriptions have been edited for accuracy.

* Gui TreeView now updates correctly when the order of tests has changed.

* An exception in TearDown now displays the actual exception at the top 
  of the stack rather than a TargetInvocationException.
