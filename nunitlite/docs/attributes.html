<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Version 1 of NUnit used the classic approach to identifying tests based on 
	inheritance and naming conventions. From version 2.0 on, NUnit has used custom 
	attributes for this purpose.</p>
<p>Because NUnit test fixtures do not inherit from a framework class, the developer 
	is free to use inheritance in other ways. And because there is no arbitrary 
	convention for naming tests, the choice of names can be entirely oriented 
	toward communicating the purpose of the test.</p>
<p>All NUnit attributes are contained in the NUnit.Framework namespace. Each source 
	file that contains tests must include a using statement for that namespace and 
	the project must reference the framework assembly, nunit.framework.dll.</p>
<p>Beginning with NUnit 2.4.6, NUnit's attributes are no longer sealed and any
    attributes that derive from them will be recognized by NUnit.
