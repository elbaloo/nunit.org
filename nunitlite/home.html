<h2>NUnitLite</h2>

<p><b>NUnitLite</b> is a new lightweight testing framework for .NET, based on 
the ideas in <a href="http://nunit.org"><b>NUnit</b></a> and providing a subset
of its features. It uses minimal resources and will run on resource-restricted
platforms such as those used in embedded and mobile development.

<p><b>NUnitLite</b> is an <b>open source</b> project, available under the 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"/>MIT License</a>,
and is being developed by members of the <b>NUnit</b> team. Future releases of NUnit
will have direct support for remote execution of NUnitLite tests.

<h3>Why an NUnitLite?</h3>

<p>Since it's introduction, NUnit has continued to add more features every year.
It was getting a bit complicated - too complicated for some purposes, such as
testing embedded projects, mobile applications or add-ins.

<p>Basically, we wanted NUnitLite to be a very simple NUnit, one that could be 
included as source right with the tests themselves. It implements a subset of 
the features of full NUnit. It has also served as a test bed for a few new 
approaches that are already finding their way into NUnit itself.

<p>The name NUnitLite is, of course, inspired by Mike Feathers' CppUnitLite.
