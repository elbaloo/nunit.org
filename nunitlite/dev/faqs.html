	<p><b><a name="source">Where can I find the latest source code for NUnitLite?</a></b>
	
	<p>The NUnitLite source code is maintained on Launchpad at
	<a href="http://launchpad.net/nunitlite">http://launchpad.net/nunitlite</a>.
		
	<p>Launchpad is an open source site with a special emphasis on making it easy
	for people to contribute to projects without the need for any special
	authorization. This idea really appeals to me.
	
	<p>A big plus for Launchpad is its use of the Bazaar distributed version 
	control system, which provides great opportunities for decentralized
	development.
	
	<p>Several NUnit-related projects are now hosted on Launchpad as part of the 
	<a href="http://launchpad.net/nunit-xtp">NUnit Extended Testing Platform</a>
	project group. The next major release (3.0) of NUnit itself will be on 
	Launchpad as well.

	<p><b><a name="codeplex">Why did you stop using Codeplex?</a></b>
	
	<p>Codeplex is a great site, but it's entirely Microsoft-oriented.
	NUnitLite - like NUnit itself - is intended to be crossplatform.
	
	<p>It also didn't help that Codeplex kept changing my project status
	to "unpublished" and threatening to remove it. :-)

	<li>
	<p><b><a name="othersites">Why not use (some other site)?</a></b>
	
	<p>There are lots of great sites for hosting open source projects
	and their capabilities are changing all the time. I picked Launchpad.
	See above for what I like about it.

	<p><b><a name="bazaar">Where can I get a copy of Bazaar?</a></b>
	
	<p>Visit the Bazaar project (<a href="http://launchpad.net/bzr">http://launchpad.net/bzr</a>),
	which is also hosted on Lauchpad. For Windows, be sure to get a Windows installer. 
	For Linux, you should be able to use your package management system to install Bazaar.

	<li>
	<p><b><a name="updateSource">How do I get a copy of the latest source for use?</a></b>
	
	<p>For this question, we assume you only need to export a copy of the source
	for use with your own test projects. See the next question if you plan to
	make changes to NUnitLite.
	
	<p>Use the command line to 	change to the directory to which you want 
	to export a copy of NUnitLite and enter	the following command:

<div class="code" style="width: 42em">
<pre>
bzr export DEST lp:nunitlite
</pre>
</div>

	<p>When the command completes, you will have a sub-directory called
	DEST containing the full NUnitLite source tree. Note that the DEST
	directory is created by the export command and must not exist beforehand.

	<li>
	<p><b><a name="branchSource">How do I get a copy of the latest source for modification?</a></b>

	<p>Unlike most centralized version control systems, Bazaar creates a
	complete, stand-alone repository on your machine by default. You will be
	able to make changes, commit to that repository, back out changes, etc.
	This is known as a "branch" in Bazaar. To create your own local branch of 
	NUnitLite, use the command line to 	change to the directory in which you want 
	to create it and enter 	the following command:

<div class="code" style="width: 42em">
<pre>
bzr branch lp:nunitlite
</pre>
</div>

	<p>When the command completes, you will have an nunitlite sub-directory 
	containing the full NUnitLite source tree as well as a local repository for 
	your own use. You can make changes and commit to your local repository.
	You can even publish your branch on Launchpad for others to use - see the 
	Launchpad and Bazaar docs for more info. If you wish, you can propose your 
	changes for merging into the official NUnit release.

	<p>The simplest build is created by using the 'build' target by itself.
	Change into the 'src' directory and enter the command:
	
	<pre>         nant build</pre>
	
	<p>This will build a debug version of NUnitLite using the default runtime on
	your system, which depends on the particular runtimes you have installed.
	To see the defaults that will be used on your system, enter the 'nant'
	command without any arguments.
	
	<p>To build a release version of NUnitLite, use the command
	<pre>         nant release build</pre>
	
	<p>To build a version that uses a particular runtime, use
	<pre>         nant RUNTIME build</pre>
	where RUNTIME may be any of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>net, net-1.0, net-1.1, net-2.0
	<li>netcf, netcf-1.0, netcf-2.0
	<li>mono, mono-1.0, mono-2.0
	</ul>
	<p>The specified runtime and sdk must be installed on your system
	in order for the build to succeed. The build output is placed
	in a subdirectory of the build directory, named according to
	the configuration and runtime, for example: build/net/2.0/release.
	
	<p>Here are some additional examples of build commands...
	
	<p>Do a clean release build using .NET 2.0.
	<pre>         nant net-2.0 release clean build</pre>
	
	<p>Build the default (debug) config for all supported runtimes
	<pre>         nant build-all</pre>
	
	<p>Clean, build and run tests using the default (debug) config and runtime.
	<pre>         nant clean build test</pre>
	
	<p>Use nant -projecthelp to see a full list of targets.

	<p><b><a name="buildWithVS">How can I build NUnitLite from source? (Visual Studio)</a></b>
	
	<p>The NUnitLite source comes with two Visual Studio 2005 solutions, located
	under the solutions directory. 
	
	<p>The vs2005 subdirectory contains a solution for building NUnitLite under 
	.NET 2.0 for use with desktop applications. It is also useful for initial 
	testing of some device applications, prior to deployment.
	
	<p>The vs2005CF subdirectory has a solution for building under the compact 
	framework, version 2.0. Use this solution in order to launch tests on
	devices or device emulators.

	<p>When building under VS, the output of the build is placed in subdirectories
	under the solution. For example, the vs2005 solution creates the NUnitLite assembly
	in the directory solutions\vs2005\NUnitLite\bin\Debug (or Release) directory.

	<li>
	<p><b><a name="usage">How do I use NUnitLite in my own project?</a></b>

	<p>Your test assembly should be built as a console application, with Main()
	executing your tests. Here is a simple Main() for use with a desktop app
	or with any device that provides a console:
	
	<div class="code"><pre>
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    new ConsoleUI().Execute(args);
}</pre></div>
	
<p>For devices without console output, you could use this version, which
writes the output to a file in the Documents folder:

	<div class="code"><pre>
static void Main(string[] args)
{
#if NETCF_1_0
    string myDocs = @"\My Documents";
#else
    string myDocs = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal);
#endif
    string path = System.IO.Path.Combine(myDocs, "TestResult.txt");
    System.IO.TextWriter writer = new System.IO.StreamWriter(path);
    new TextUI(writer).Execute(args);
    writer.Close();
}</pre></div>

	<p>Another option is to use DebugUI, which writes test results to Debug.
	This has the advantage of working in either environment. Additional 
	runner UIs are under development and may be found in the source 
	in the file TextUI.cs
	
	<p>Of course, to make use of any of these techniques, you must have 
	NUnitLite available. You can do this by incorporating the source code for
	NUnitLite into your test assembly or by adding a reference to it. If you
	use a reference, you may choose to build the NUnitLite assembly as a 
	part of your project or build it separately and simply copy the dll.

	<li>
	<p><b><a name="device">How can I execute my tests on a device?</a></b>

	<p>Currently, this is only supported through use of Visual Studio. Simply
	build your project for the appropriate device. Then, after making sure that
	your test assembly and all dependencies are marked for deployment, execute
	the test in the normal way - with or without Debug. Visual Studio will
	deploy your assemblies to the device and run the test.
	
	<p>A future release will support deployment and execution without use
	of Visual Studio.

	<p><b><a name="buildWithCSExpress">How to build NUnit from source using Visual C# Express</a></b>
	
	<p>You may open either Visual Studio solution using Visual C# Express. Because
	C# Express does not support solution folders, you will encounter an error,
	which you should be able to ignore. If necessary, you may delete the solution
	folder from the solution, but if you do so, please don't check it back into
	the NUnit source code repository.
