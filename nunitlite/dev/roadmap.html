<h2>NUnitLite Roadmap</h2>

<p>This page lists completed and planned features by expected release number.
It's rough and subject to change. See the

<h3>Planned Features</h3>

<p>The following table lists features we plan to implement in version 1.0 of
NUnitLite. Planned releases may well be combined or others may be added.
Features may be added or dropped. In particular, see the next table, which
lists features being considered.

<p>After the 1.0 release, we plan to merge the source code of NUnit and NUnitLite
and use conditional compilation to produce each assembly. However, if NUnit 3.0 
development proceeds more rapidly than expected, this merging could take place  
before the 1.0 release, but is not expected to impact the availability of
features in NUnitLite.

<table class="roadmap">
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Release</th><th>Status</th></tr>
<tr><td>Support for .NET 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0, .NET CF 3.5 and 4.0? and 
    corresponding Mono releases.</td>
	<td>0.6</td>
	<td>The existing implementations are expected to work without problem on newer 
	    versions but changes may be needed to take advantage of new features.</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Allow use of static methods for tests,
	SetUp, TearDown, TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown.</td>
	<td>0.6</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>PlatformAttribute</td>
	<td>0.6</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>CategoryAttribute</td>
	<td>0.6</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Test runner should produce Xml output using a defined schema. Initially
		the schema may be different from that used by NUnit. A common schema
		is planned for a future NUnit release.</td>
	<td>0.7</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Test runner should send final output (text or xml) to a TCP endpoint provided
        by a desktop runner program.
	<td>0.7</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Standalone app for deploying and running tests and displaying results sent via TCP</td>
	<td>0.7</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Send incremental result packets for each test via TCP, while
        the test run goes on. Desktop runner should show results progressively
		and save the xml file for the full run.</td>
	<td>0.8</td>
	<td>Requires defining a format, which might be SOAP, custom XML, JSON or something entirely different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standalone desktop gui to view NUnitLite xml results.</td>
	<td>0.8</td>
	<td>Based on existing NUnit viewer. NUnit itself may do this in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Support for Linux devices running Mono</td>
	<td>0.9</td>
	<td>Since most Linux-based devices run a fairly complete Mono implementation, 
	    this is expected to work without further effort. It needs testing, however.</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Support for the .NET Micro Framework</td>
	<td>0.9</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Preliminary documentation and examples</td>
	<td>0.9</td>
	<td></td></tr>

<h3>Additional Features</h3>

<p>This table lists features under consideration for inclusion
in a future release of NUnitLite as well as those that may be implemented separately
from NUnitLite itself.

<table class="roadmap">
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Release</th><th>Status</th></tr>
<tr><td>Report each successful Assert in addition to failures</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>Could be useful in some heavily validated domains, such as medical</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Report errors without use of exceptions either as a run-time or a compilation option</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>Some platforms or environments are not friendly to Exceptions</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Recognize and run NUnitLite tests in NUnit, with support for all features.</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>This implies an add-in for NUnit in order to recognize inheritance-based
	    tests and to apply NUnitLite semantics to the test run.</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: 1pt black solid"><td>Run and display results in a simple Gui runner on the device</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>For serious project work, this is probably not needed. However, it's
	    easy to do and may be useful for testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use NUnit to deploy and run tests on a device receiving results via TCP as the test progresses</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>Not expected before the NUnit 3.0 release</td></tr>
<tr><td>NAnt task for executing NUnitLite tests</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>NUnit task may be modified to do this</td></tr>
<tr><td>MsBuild task for executing NUnitLite tests</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>Could be part of an NUnit task</td></tr>
<tr><td>VS2005/2008 add-in for running NUnitLite tests</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan=3>In each case, this feature could be part of an NUnit add-in</td></tr>
<tr><td>SharpDevelop add-in for running NUnitLite tests</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>MonoDevelop add-in for running NUnitLite tests</td>
	<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Add-in testing support for Visual Studio.</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan=2>In each case, this will likely be in the form of an add-in that tests other add-ins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add-in testing support for Office.</td>
	<td></td></tr>
