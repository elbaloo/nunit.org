<h2>NUnitLite Vision</h2>

<p>From our <a href="index.php?p=home">Home Page</a>...</p>

<blockquote><b><i>NUnitLite is a new lightweight testing framework for .NET, based on 
the ideas in <a href="../index.php"><b>NUnit</b></a>
and providing a subset of its features. </i></b></blockquote>

<p>On this page, we spell out what that statement means - the Vision for what
NUnitLite is and will become in more or less high-level terms. For specific features
and an implementation plan, see our <a href="index.php?p=roadmap">Roadmap</a> page.

<h4>Device Development</h4>
<p>NUnitLite brings the benefit of NUnit-like unit testing to devices. Specifically,
programmers will be able to run NUnitLite tests on devices that support
the .NET Compact Framework, either directly or through the NUnit user interface.

<h4>Plugins and Addins</h4>
<p>NUnitLite also targets testing of plugins and addins, which run under the
control of another applications. Such projects are hard to test using standard
approaches, since the tests normally run under the control of a test runner,
while the addin needs to run under the control of its host. Developers can
use NUnitLite in this environment by "embedding" it in their addin, just as
is done in device programming.

<h4>Lightweight Framework</h4>
<p>NUnitLite will not suffer the weight of NUnit features like extensibility, 
a gui, multi-threading, use of separate AppDomains, etc. All these features have 
their place but they can generally be dispensed with in resource-limited situations
or when the tests must run in some special environment

<h4>Platform Support</h4>
<p>NUnitLite is cross-platform. Initially, it will support the .NET framework,
.NET Compact Framework, Mono profiles 1.0 and 2.0 an the .NET Micro Framework.
In general, all versions of these frameworks are supported, although some 
features may not be available on all frameworks.

<h4>Delivered as Source</h4>
<p>NUnitLite is delivered as source code only, for inclusion directly in the users'
test projects.

<h4>NUnit Supported</h4>
<p>NUnit will provide Gui runner support and display test results for NUnitLite.
Developers will be able to use NUnitLite standalone, through NUnit or in a hybrid
mode in which NUnit simply displays the results of tests run by NUnitLite.

<h4>Open Source Software</h4>
<p>NUnitLite is and will remain open source, allowing companies to use and extend
it without restriction for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. NUnitLite
is currently using the OSL license for its alpha releases. A final choice of 
license will be made prior to the first production release.
