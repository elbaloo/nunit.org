    <h3>Report a bug or request a new feature</h3>

    <p>
      For bugs, first make sure it really is a bug. Post on the mailing list if you aren't sure.

    <p>
      Next check the relevant issue list on GitHub (see below) to see if someone else has already
      reported the same issue. If so, you can add more details as a comment.

    <p>
      When submitting a new issue giving as much information as you can. For bugs, be sure to
      include the version of NUnit you are using together with information about
      the environment in which you are running. In particular, let us know if the
      problem relates to running with a third-party runner like TD.Net or Resharper.
      For new features, try to describe clearly what you want.
