<h3>What Is NUnit?</h3>

<p>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from <a href="http://www.junit.org" target="_self">
		JUnit</a>, the current production release, version 2.6, is the seventh major release of 
	this xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely 
	in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET 
	language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related 
	capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.</p>
	
<p>NUnit 3.0 is currently under development and is a complete rewrite of NUnit. With
   a new infrastructure and new features. An alpha release is currently available.</p>

   while NUnit 3.0 uses the <a href="nuget/nunit3-license.txt">MIT license</a>. Both of these licenses
   allow the use of NUnit in free and commercial applications and libraries without restrictions.

<p>The NUnit team invests a great deal of time and effort to make NUnit a 
   useful tool. In addition, we have expenses. We have to purchase domain names, 
   arrange for web site hosting and acquire equipment.
   
<p>Making a financial contribution is one way in which you can help us ensure 
   that NUnit continues to develop and remains free and open software. For
   more information or to view a list of donors, see our
