<h3>What Is NUnit?</h3>

<p>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from 
   <a href="http://www.junit.org" target="_self">JUnit</a>, the current production 
   release, version 3.0, has been completely rewritten with many new features and 
   support for a wide range of .NET platforms.</p>
	   
<h3>License</h3>

<p>NUnit is Open Source software and NUnit 3.0 is released under the
   <a href="nuget/nunit3-license.txt">MIT license</a>.
.  Earlier releases used the <a href="nuget/license.html">NUnit license</a> 
   Both of these licenses allow the use of NUnit in free and commercial applications
   and libraries without restrictions.

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>NUnit 3.0 was created by Charlie Poole, Rob Prouse, Simone Busoli, Neil Colvin and
   numerous community contributors.
   
<p>Earlier versions of NUnit were developed by Charlie Poole, James W. Newkirk, 
   Alexei A. Vorontsov, Michael C. Two and Philip A. Craig.</p>

<p>The NUnit team invests a great deal of time and effort to make NUnit a 
   useful tool. In addition, we have expenses. We have to purchase domain names, 
   arrange for web site hosting and acquire equipment.
   
<p>Making a financial contribution is one way in which you can help us ensure 
   that NUnit continues to develop and remains free and open software. For
   more information or to view a list of donors, see our
