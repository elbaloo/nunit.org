			NUnit 2.0 is an

				transliterate the Smalltalk or Java version. That's what we did with NUnit at 
				first, too. This new version is NUnit as it would have been done had it been 
				done in C# to begin with.

<h3>What Is NUnit?</h3>

<p>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from <a href="http://www.junit.org" target="_self">
		JUnit</a>, the current production release, version 2.6, is the seventh major release of 
	this xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely 
	in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET 
	language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related 
	capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.</p>
    
<h3>License</h3>

<p>NUnit 3 is released under the <a href="nuget/mit_license.txt">MIT license</a>. All previous versions are under 
    the <a href="nuget/license.html">NUnit license</a>. Both of these licenses allow the use of NUnit in free and 
    commercial applications and libraries without restrictions.

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>The current release of NUnit was created by Charlie Poole, Jordan Terrell
   and Simone Busoli. Earlier versions of NUnit were developed by Charlie Poole, 
   James W. Newkirk, Alexei A. Vorontsov, Michael C. Two and Philip A. Craig.

<p>We would also like to thank the following people for their contributions and support: 
   Jamie Cansdale, Cvetomir Todorov, Doug de la Torre, David White, Ethan Smith, Al Gonzalez, 
   Ron Jeffries and Rob Jeffries. A special acknowledgment needs to be sent to Kent Beck 
   and Erich Gamma because without their efforts none of this would have been possible.

<p>The NUnit team invests a great deal of time and effort to make NUnit a 
   useful tool. In addition, we have expenses. We have to purchase domain names, 
   arrange for web site hosting and acquire equipment.
   
<p>Making a financial contribution is one way in which you can help us ensure 
   that NUnit continues to develop and remains free and open software. For
   more information or to view a list of donors, see our
