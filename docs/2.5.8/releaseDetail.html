<h3>NUnit 2.5.8 - Version 2.5.8.10295 - October 22, 2010</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>The test file mock-assembly.dll has been enhanced to contain examples of all
types of test suites for use in development of custom test reports.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>SubDirectoryConstraint has been removed and is replaced by SubPathConstraint, which operates on paths without the need to access the underlying directories.
<li>Custom attributes may now be derived from ExplicitAttribute.
<li>New key words "Windows7" and "Windows2008ServerR2" are recognized by the PlatformAttribute.
<li>A warning is now given if a test changes the current directory.
</ul>

<h4>Console Runner</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new /trace option may be used to set NUnit's internal trace level for a console run.
</ul>

<h4>Gui Runner</h4>

<ul>
<li>Stability problems with the NUnit Gui under Linux have been resolved and NUnit 2.5.8 is the recommended release for all platforms. Various cosmetic fixes have been made under Linux as well, so that the Gui functions in the same way as it does under Windows.
<li>A new setting dialog allows control of NUnit's InternalTrace facility, which was previously controlled by an entry in the config file.
<li>Tests run out of process may be debugged by attaching to the nunit-agent process once,
since the same process is now used across multiple reloads of the test assembly.
</ul>
