<h2>Assert.That() Method (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>The Assert.That() method is used for all constraint based assertions by
   accepting the specific constraint object as an argument. In addition, for
   syntactic convenience, it allows asserting on a boolean condition, in
   which case it functions as a synonym for IsTrue.

<div class="code" style="width: 36em">
<pre>Assert.That( object actual, IConstraint constraint )
Assert.That( object actual, IConstraint constraint, string message )
Assert.That( object actual, IConstraint constraint, string message, 
             object[] parms )
			 
Assert.That( bool condition );
Assert.That( bool condition, string message );
Assert.That( bool condition, string message, object[] parms );</pre>
</div>

<p>The constraint argument must be a object implementing the
   <b>IConstraint</b> interface, which supports performing a test
   on an actual value and generating appropriate messages. This interface
   is described in more detail under 
   <?= nunit_doc_link( "customConstraints", "Custom Constraints" ) ?>.
   
<p>Constraints may be either 
   <?= nunit_doc_link( "constraints", "built-in" ) ?> or 
   <?= nunit_doc_link( "customConstraints", "custom" ) ?>. They may be created
   directly in the user code using <b>new</b> or through one of the
   <?= nunit_doc_link( "syntaxHelpers", "syntax helpers" ) ?>.
