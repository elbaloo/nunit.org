<h2>NUnit 2.4.2</h2>
	
<p>This documentation covers the NUnit 2.4.2 release, which corrects several
   issues found in NUnit 2.4 and 2.4.1 and makes a few minor improvements. Except
   where there have been visual changes, screen shots still reflect the 2.4 release.
   Where applicable, we have marked sections with the version in which a feature 
   first appeared.</p>

<p>If you are new to NUnit, we suggest you begin by reading the 
	<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "getStarted", "Getting Started" ) ?> section of this site.
	 Those who have used earlier releases may want to begin with the 
	<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "upgrade", "Upgrading" ) ?> section.</p>

<p>See the 
   <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "releaseNotes", "Release Notes" ) ?>
   for more information on this release.</p>

<p>All documentation is included in the release packages of NUnit. Beginning with NUnit 
2.4.2, you may choose to <a href="index.php?p=download">download</a> the documentation
separately.</p>
