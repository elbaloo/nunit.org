<h3>NUnit 2.4.1 - May 3, 2007</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>When the NUnit help is not installed, the Help menu item now displays the
documentation from the NUnit web site.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The following Assert overloads have been added
   <dl style="margin-left: 2em">
     <dt>Assert.Greater(long, long)
     <dt>Assert.Greater(ulong, ulong)
	 <dt>Assert.GreaterOrEqual(long, long)
	 <dt>Assert.GreaterOrEqual(ulong, ulong)
	 <dt>Assert.Less(long, long)
	 <dt>Assert.Less(ulong, ulong)
	 <dt>Assert.LessOrEqual(long, long)
	 <dt>Assert.LessOrEqual(ulong, ulong)
   </dl>
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>When a load or reload is in progress, an indicator message is now
displayed, centered on top of the form. The form is now displayed 
earlier in the startup sequence so that error messages do not appear
in isolation.

<li>When a non-existent assembly is specified on the command line, the
gui no longer closes after the error message is dismissed.

<li>When the option to re-run tests when assembly changes is selected,
the last set of tests run is now re-run, rather than running all tests.

<li>The failure message for tests failing due to a problem with the
TestFixtureSetUp now indicate the name of the failing fixture.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>The TestCase class has a new virtual method <b>MakeTestCaseResult()</b>,
allowing extensions to use a derived TestCaseResult if desired. Because
NUnit makes no use of additional properties or methods added to the 
TestCaseResult, some sort of custom processing is required for this
feature to be useful. Extenders should be aware that inheriting from
TestCase currently makes the extension dependent on a particular version 
of NUnit.

<li>A brief list of "Tips for Writing Extensions" has been added to the documentation.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>CollectionAsserts no longer fail on collections containig null values.

<li>The obsolete file, <b>nunit-gui.exe</b>, has been removed from the zip distribution.

<li>The errors and failures display now recalculates the space available and 
enables or disables the scrollbar whenever it is resized.

<li>The xml file automatically saved by the Gui when a test is run is now
correctly named as TestResult.xml rather than TestTesult.xml.

<li>The <b>Explicit</b> attribute now works correctly when specified on
a test fixture.

<li>The /cleanup option no longer throws an exception when the shadow copy
cache directory is not present.

<li>The current directory is now set correctly when running a <b>SetUpFixture</b>.

<li>Non-default test load options are no longer ignored when loading tests in
multiple AppDomains.

<li>The Errors and Failures display is now re-drawn with the scroll bars
enabled/disabled as needed whenever it is resized.

<li>The MaxTimeDecorator example no longer shows the name of a test
case repeated twice in the full name of the test.
</ul>
