<h2>Custom Constraints (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>You can implement your own custom constraints by creating a class
that implements the <b>IConstraint</b> interface, which supports performing a test
   on an actual value and generating appropriate messages. The interface is
   defined as follows:
   
<div class="code" style="width: 36em">
<pre>public interface IConstraint
{
    bool Matches( object actual );
    void WriteMessageTo( MessageWriter writer );
    void WriteDescriptionTo( MessageWriter writer );
    void WriteActualValueTo( MessageWriter writer );
}</pre>
</div>   

<p>One approach is to derive from the abstract class Constraint, which 
provides the <b>&amp;</b> and <b>|</b> operators as well as a default
implementation of the WriteMessageTo() and WriteActualValueTo() methods.

<p>Your derived class should save the actual argument to Matches for later use.
If deriving from Constraint, use the protected field actual for this purpose.

<p>The MessageWriter abstract class is implemented in the framework by
TextMessageWriter. Examining the source for some of the builtin constraints
should give you a good idea of how to use it.
