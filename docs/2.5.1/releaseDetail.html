<h3>NUnit 2.5.1 - Version 2.5.1.9189 - July 8, 2009</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new <b>TestResult</b> state has been defined for tests cancelled by the
    user. Results with <b>ResultState.Cancelled</b> are reported as a type of
	failure and no longer generate an ApplicationException.
<li>Parameterized test fixtures with <b>TestCaseSource</b> or <b>ValueSource</b> 
	data are now constructed using the appropriate parameterized constructor 
	when test cases are being created. This avoids the need for a default
	constructor and permits use of member data initialized from
	the fixture parameters in creating the test data.
<li>The <b>TestCaseData</b> class now supports use of a string or other
    array type as the sole argument value, without the need to nest
	that array in an object array.
<li>Abstract classes marked with <b>TestFixtureAttribute</b> are no longer
    reported as ignored or non-runnable.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> This was changed in 2.5 but was omitted from the release notes.
<li>The methods in the <b>Text</b> class are now marked as obsolete. For string 
	constraints, use one of the following at the start of an expression:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is.StringContaining</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringStarting</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringEnding</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringMatching</b>
	</ul>
	Within an expression (afer Not, Some, All, And, Or, etc.) you may use
	<ul>
	<li><b>Contains</b> or <b>ContainsSubstring</b>
	<li><b>StartsWith</b>
	<li><b>EndsWith</b>
	<li><b>Matches</b>	
	</ul>
<li><b>ThrowsConstraint</b> now has a constructor taking an <b>ActualValueDelegate</b>
    in addition to the constructor that takes a <b>TestDelegate</b>. This allows
	simpler use of Lambda expressions under C# 3.0, but requires users of pre-3.0
	compilers to disambiguate their delegates by use of an explicit return
	expression.
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<li>Individual test cases under a parameterized test are
    no longer sorted by name within the test group but are
	run (and shown in the Gui) in the order in which the
	data is retrieved.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Since the order of retrieval of custom
	attributes is not guaranteed by the CLR, the order
	of test cases will not necessarily match the textual
	ordering of attributes in the source code. The order
	of tests will vary across different compilers and
	CLR versions as well.
<li>The XML test result file now contains a count of 
	inconclusive results.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The default icons in the Gui tree have been updated.
<li>Alternative icons placed by the user in the directory containing
    nunit.uikit.dll may now be in PNG format. Icons are now recognized
	for Skipped and Inconclusive status in addition to Success, Failure
	and Ignored.
<li>A new setting option allows the user to disable checking for the 
    existence of files in the Recent Files list before listing them. This
    prevents NUnit from appearing to freeze when the file is on a network
    path that is no longer connected.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>ITestCaseProvider2</b> and <b>IDatapointProvider2</b> interfaces
    extend <b>ITestCaseProvider</b> and <b>IDatapointProvider</b>
    with methods that include the fixture for which the test case is being
    built. Providers may implement either the old or the new interface, 
	but the new interface is required if the data source is contained in
	the test fixture itself so that the fixture may be constructed with
	the proper parameters in the case of a parameterized fixture.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lambda in Throws constraint was not compiling correctly.
<li>Null reference exception is no longer thrown when adding an assembly to a 
    new project that has not yet been saved.
<li>Dispose is now called on disposable types created while loading test case 
    parameters.
<li>Installations that copy NUnit to a single folder (no lib or framework folders) 
    now work correctly.
<li>Test Assemblies menu item is no longer enabled when no test was loaded
<li>The Text Output tab of the Settings dialog no longer causes an exception
    when invoked from the mini-gui.
<li>Errors in various copyright statements were fixed and the year updated to 2009.
<li>Control characters in test arguments are now escaped in the display.
<li>Additional control characters are now escaped in error messages.
<li>Miscellaneous typographic corrections were made to the documentation.
</ul>
