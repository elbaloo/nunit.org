<h2>From NUnit 2.2</h2>

<p>Beginning with version 2.2.1, old style test cases ("Test....") are no longer 
recognized by default. We recommend that you convert such test cases to use the
 nunit_doc_link( "test", "TestAttribute" ). Alternatively, you may
specify a setting in the test config file to allow use of old style test cases by
default.</p>

<h2>From NUnit 1.x</h2>

<p>Upgrading requires a minimal amount of work. Since the framework still looks for 
	test methods by name in addition to the attributes, <b>no test method will need to 
		be modified to upgrade to the new version</b>. The only source code change 
	required is to remove the constructor with the string parameter in the class 
	that inherits from TestCase. The only new requirement is that you have a 
	default constructor. If there was significant processing in the existing 
	constructor then just move it to the default constructor. The only other change 
	is to change the reference to nunit.framework.dll instead of the V1.x framework 
	dll. Using the TestCase class has been marked obsolete so you will get 
	warnings, but they can be ignored for now!&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Suite property</h3>
<p>The existing Suite property will not be found by the new program. These must be 
	changed to the &quot;Suite&quot; attribute for the test runners to find them. 
	Another alternative is that these suites are no longer needed due to the 
	automatic capability that is built in to the new version.</p>
<h3>AssertionFailedError</h3>
<p>If you have written code expecting the exception AssertionFailedError, this must 
	be changed to AssertionException.</p>
