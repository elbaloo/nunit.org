<h3>ParallelizableAttribute (NUnit 3.0)</h3> 

<p>This attribute is used to indicate whether the test and/or its descendants may be run in parallel with other tests. By default, no parallel execution takes place.

<p>The constructor takes an optional <b>ParallelScope</b> enumeration argument (see below), which defaults to <b>ParallelScope.Self</b>. The attribute may be used at the assembly, class or method level and the word "test" in the rest of this description refers to the suite or test case that corresponds to the item on which the attribute appears.

<p>The Scope may also be specified using the named property <b>Scope=</b>.

<h4>ParallelScope Enumeration</h4>

<p>This is a <b>[Flags]</b> enumeration used to specify which tests may run in parallel. It applies to the test upon which it appears and any subordinate tests. It is defined as follows:
<div class="code"><pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
    [Flags]
    public enum ParallelScope
    {
        None,     // the test may not be run in parallel with other tests
        Self,     // the test itself may be run in parallel with other tests
        Children, // child tests may be run in parallel with respect to one another
        Fixtures  // fixtures may be run in parallel with one another
    }
</pre></code>

Values that apply to a higher level test than the test on which the scope appears - for example, ParallelScope.Fixtures appearing on a method - are ignored without warning or affect.

<h4>Specifying Parallelizable at Multiple Test Levels</h4>

<p>The <b>ParallelizableAttribute</b> may be specified on multiple levels of the tests, with lower-level specifications overriding higher ones. Thus, if the assembly has <b>ParallelScope.None</b> either by use of the attribute or by default, classes with <b>ParallelScope.Self</b> may be run in parallel as may their children if an appropriate scope is used.

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>In the current release, parallel execution of methods within a class is not yet implemented.

<li><p>The <b>ParallelAttribute</b> only applies at the level on which it appears and below. It cannot override settings on higher-level tests. Thus, allowing parallel execution for methods of a class that does not allow it, results in those methods running in parallel with one another, but not in parallel with test methods under any other classes. This is the natural outcome of the fact that the execution of a test method is, in fact, part of the execution of the test represented by the class.
