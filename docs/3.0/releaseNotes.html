<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h5>NOTE: A combined description of changes since NUnit 2.6.3 is under development along with a summary statement of major features. Both will be available in the first Beta release.</h5>

<h3>NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 5 - January 30, 2015</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>A Windows installer is now included in the release packages.
</ul>
 
<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts IncludePlatform and ExcludePlatform properties to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run.
<li>TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test.

  <ul>
  <li>--testlist provides a list of tests to run in a file
  <li>--stoponerror indicates that the run should terminate when any test fails.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Issues Resolved</h4>

<ul>
<li>20 TestCaseAttribute needs Platform property.
<li>60 NUnit should support async setup, teardown, fixture setup and fixture teardown.
<li>257  TestCaseAttribute should not require parameters with default values to be specified.
<li>266  Pluggable framework drivers.
<li>368  Create addin model.
<li>369  Project loader addins

<li>442  Add --stoponerror option back to nunit-console.
<li>456  Fix memory leak in RuntimeFramework.
<li>459  Remove the Mixed Platforms build configuration.
<li>468  Change default domain usage to multiple.
<li>469  Truncate string arguments in test names in order to limit the length.
</ul>

<li>The Pairwise strategy test case generation algorithm has been improved.
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>A driver is now included, which allows running NUnit 2.x tests under NUnit 3.0.
<li>The engine can now load and run tests specified in a number of project formats:
  <ul>
   <li>NUnit (.nunit)
   <li>Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj)
   <li>Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj)
   <li>Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj)

<h3>NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 3 - November 29, 2014</h3>

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction
   between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms.
<li>The release includes two new framework builds: compact framework 3.5 and portable. The portable
   library is compatible with .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1,
   Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and MonoTouch.
<li>A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework:
  <ul>
    <li>Generic methods as tests
    <li>RegexConstraint
    <li>TimeoutAttribute
    <li>FileAssert, DirectoryAssert and file-related constraints
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Engine</h4>

<ul>
<li>The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default
   in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built.
<li>On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit,
   depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. 
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may
   still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options.
<li>The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making
   it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line.
<li>The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system.
<li>A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests.
<li>The -teamcity option is now supported.
</ul>

<h4>Issues Resolved</h4>

<ul>
 <li>12   Compact framework should support generic methods
 <li>145  NUnit-console fails if test result message contains invalid xml characters
 <li>155  Create utility classes for platform-specific code
 <li>223  Common code for NUnitLite console runner and NUnit-Console
 <li>225  Compact Framework Support
 <li>238  Improvements to running 32 bit tests on a 64 bit system
 <li>261  Add portable nunitlite build
 <li>284  NUnitLite Unification
 <li>293  CF does not have a CurrentDirectory
 <li>306  Assure NUnit can write resultfile
 <li>308  Early disposal of runners
 <li>309  NUnit-Console should support incremental output under TeamCity
 <li>325  Add RegexConstraint to compact framework build
 <li>326  Add TimeoutAttribute to compact framework build
 <li>327  Allow generic test methods in the compact framework
 <li>328  Use .NET Stopwatch class for compact framework builds
 <li>331  Alpha 2 CF does not build
 <li>333  Add parallel execution to desktop builds of NUnitLite
 <li>334  Include File-related constraints and syntax in NUnitLite builds
 <li>335  Re-introduce 'Classic' NUnit syntax in NUnitLite
 <li>336  Document use of separate obj directories per build in our projects
 <li>337  Update Standard Defines page for .NET 3.0
 <li>341  Move the NUnitLite runners to separate assemblies
 <li>367  Refactor XML Escaping Tests
 <li>372  CF Build TestAsesemblyRunnerTests
 <li>373  Minor CF Test Fixes
 <li>378  Correct documentation for PairwiseAttribute
 <li>386  Console Output Improvements
</ul>

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

<ul>
 <li>The console runner no longer displays test results in the debugger.
 <li>The NUnitLite compact framework 2.0 build has been removed.
 <li>All addin support has been removed from the framework. Documentation of NUnit 3.0 extensibility features will be published in time for the beta release. In the interim, please ask for support on the nunit-discuss list.
