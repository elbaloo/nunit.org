<h2>NUnit-Console</h2>

<p>The nunit-console.exe program is a text-based runner for listing and running
  your tests from the command-line. It is able to run all NUnit 3.0 or higher tests 
  natively and can run NUnit 2.x tests if the v2 driver is installed.</p>
  
<p>This runner is useful for automation of tests and integration into other systems.
  It automatically saves its results in XML format, allowing you to produce reports 
	or otherwise process the results. The following is a screenshot of the console 
	program output.</p>

<div class="screenshot-left">
      <?php echo nunit_doc_img( "console-mock.png" ) ?>
</div>
<p>
<p>In this example, nunit-console has just run the tests in the mock-assembly.dll 
	that is part of the NUnit distribution. This assembly contains a number of tests, some
	of which are either ignored or marked explicit. The summary line shows the
	result of the test run. Click <?php echo nunit_doc_file( "TestResult.xml", "here" ) ?> 
	to see the XML produced for this test run.</p>
