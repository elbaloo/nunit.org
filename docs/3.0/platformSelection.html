<h3>Platform Selection</h3>

<p>If your tests are compiled x86 or x64, NUnit will run your
tests in nunit-agent targeted at the appropriate platform. If you
specify multiple assemblies on the command line and they target different
processors, you <b>must</b> specify <b>/process=Multiple</b> on the command
line to run each of your assemblies in a different process.</p>

<p>On an x64 machine, if your test assembly is compiled x86, you <b>must not</b>
use <b>/process=Single</b> on the command line. NUnit will respect your directive and
attempt to load the x86 assembly into the x64 process which will obviously fail.</p>

<p>If your assembly is compiled AnyCPU, but references x86 or x64 assemblies, it is incorrect.
If your assembly references platform specific assemblies, it should specify the same platform
as the referenced assemblies.</p>
