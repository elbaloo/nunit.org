<h2>Equality Asserts</h2>

<p>
    These methods test whether the two arguments are equal. Overloaded
    methods are provided for common value types so that languages that don't
    automatically box values can use them directly.
</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">Assert.AreEqual( double expected, double actual, double tolerance );
Assert.AreEqual( double expected, double actual, double tolerance, string message, 
                    params object[] parms );

Assert.AreEqual( object expected, object actual );
Assert.AreEqual( object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms );

Assert.AreNotEqual( object expected, object actual );
Assert.AreNotEqual( object expected, object actual, string message, params object[] parms );</pre>

<h4>Comparing Numerics of Different Types</h4>

<p>
    The method overloads that compare two objects make special provision so that numeric
    values of different types compare as expected. This assert succeeds:
    <pre class="prettyprint">Assert.AreEqual( 5, 5.0 );</pre>
</p>

<h4>Comparing Floating Point Values</h4>

<p>
    Values of type float and double are normally compared using an additional
    argument that indicates a tolerance within which they will be considered
    as equal. Beginning with NUnit 2.4.4, the value of
    <b>GlobalSettings.DefaultFloatingPointTolerance</b> is used if a third argument
    is not provided. In earlier versions, or if the default has not been set,
    values are tested for exact equality.

<p>Special values are handled so that the following Asserts succeed:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">Assert.AreEqual( double.PositiveInfinity, double.PositiveInfinity );
Assert.AreEqual( double.NegativeInfinity, double.NegativeInfinity );
Assert.AreEqual( double.NaN, double.NaN );</pre>

<blockquote>
    <i>
        <b>Note:</b> The last example above represents a change with NUnit 2.2.3.
        In earlier releases, the test would fail. We have made this change
        because the new behavior seems to be more useful in tests. To avoid confusion,
        we suggest using the new Assert.IsNaN method where appropriate.

<h4>Comparing Arrays and Collections</h4>

<p>
    Since version 2.2, NUnit has been able to compare two single-dimensioned arrays.
    Beginning with version 2.4, multi-dimensioned arrays, nested arrays (arrays of arrays)
    and collections may be compared. Two arrays or collections will be treated as equal
    by Assert.AreEqual if they have the same dimensions and if each of the corresponding
    elements is equal. NUnit 3.0 adds the ability to compare generic collections and dictionaries.</p>
