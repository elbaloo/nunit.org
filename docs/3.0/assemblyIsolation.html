<h3>Assembly Isolation</h3>

<p>NUnit isolates test assemblies from its own code and from one another
   by use of separate Processes and AppDomains.
   
<p>By default, NUnit loads each test assembly into a separate <b>Process</b>
   under the control of the <?php echo nunit_doc_link("nunit-agent", "nunit-agent") ?>
   program. This allows NUnit to ensure that each assembly is loaded in the environment
   for which it was built. Within the agent process, NUnit's own code runs in the primary   
   <b>AppDomain</b> while the tests run in a separate <b>AppDomain</b>.
   
<p>If desired, multiple test assemblies may be loaded into the same process and
   even the same domain by use of the <b>-process</b> and <b>-domain</b> command-line
   options. See
   <?php echo nunit_doc_link("consoleCommandLine", "NUnit-Console Command Line Options") ?>
   for more information.
