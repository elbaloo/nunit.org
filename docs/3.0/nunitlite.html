<h3>NUnitLite Runner</h4>

<p>NUnitLite started out life as a separate version of the NUnit framework, with fewer features 
and a built-in test runner. It ran on devices as well as on desktop .NET and mono and allowed 
users to create executable tests without the overhead of a full NUnit installation.</p>

<p>With NUnit 3.0, the NUnitLite framework has been merged with the full NUnit framework. There
is now only one framework, <b>nunit.framework.dll</b>. The built-in runner, 
which was a part of the old NUnitLite, is now packaged as <b>nunitlite.dll</b>.</p>

<h4>Using NUnitLite</h4>

<p>To run tests under NUnitLite, proceed as follows:

<ol>
<li>Create a console application to use as your test assembly. If you have already placed tests in a dll, you can change the project so that it produces a console application and reload it.
<li>Make sure your test assembly references both <b>nunit.framework</b> and <b>nunitlite</b>.
<li>The Main() for your console application should look something like this...
<pre class="prettyprint">
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      new TextUI().Execute(args);
    }
</pre>
<li>Execute your test application in order to run the tests.
<p>
<p>If you install the NUnitLite runner via the NuGet package, steps 2 and 3 are handled
automatically. Both assemblies are installed and referenced and a file, Program.cs, is added 
to your project with a Main() like that above.
</ol>

<h4>NUnitLite Output</h4>

<p>As seen in the following screen shot, the output from an NUnitLite run is quite similar to that from the console runner.</p?
