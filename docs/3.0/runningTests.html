<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>Nunit provides a <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "nunit-console", "console runner" ) ?>, 
    nunit-console.exe, which is used for batch execution of tests. The console
    runner works through the <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "testEngine", "NUnit Test Engine") ?>,
    which provides it with the ability to load, explore and execute tests. When
    tests are to be run in a separate process, the engine makes use of the
    <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "nunit-agent", "nunit-agent" ) ?> program to run them.
    
<p>The <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "nunitlite", "NUnitLite" ) ?> runner may
    be used in situations where a simpler runner is more suitable.

<h3>Third-Party Runners</h3>

<p>Various third-party applications are available for loading and running
   NUnit tests. Some of these actually use NUnit to load the tests, while
   others provide their own emulation and may not work in the same way 
   that NUnit does.
   
<p>Because the status of such projects may change from time to time, we don't
   discuss them individually here. For the latest information, consult the 
   manufacturer of any third-party software or ask other users on our
   <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nunit-discuss">discussion list</a>.
