<h3>SuiteBuilders (NUnit 2.4)</h3>

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>A SuiteBuilder is an addin used to build a test fixture from a type. NUnit itself
uses a SuiteBuilder to recognize and build TestFixtures. 

<h4>Extension Point</h4>
<p>An addin may use the host to access this extension point by name:

<pre>
	IExtensionPoint suiteBuilders = host.GetExtensionPoint( "SuiteBuilders" );</pre>

<h4>Interface</h4>
<p>The extension object passed to Install must implement the ISuiteBuilder interface:

<pre>
	public interface ISuiteBuilder
	{
		bool CanBuildFrom( Type type );
		Test BuildFrom( Type type );
	}
</pre>

<p>CanBuildFrom should return true if the specified Type is one from which
the builder is able to create a fixture. This usually involve examining
the Type and its attriutes.

<p>The BuildFrom method should return a test fixture completely populated
with its contained test cases. Return null if it is not possible to 
build a fixture using the provided Type.
