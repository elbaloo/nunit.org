<h3>DataSourceAttribute (NUnit 2.5)</h3>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 10%; padding: 4px 0; border: 2px solid black">
  <h4>Preliminary documentation, subject to change.</h4>
</div>

<p><b>DataSourceAttribute</b> is used on individual parameters of a test method to
identify the source from which arguments will be suppoied. The attribute has 
four public constructors.

<div class="code">
<pre>
DataSourceAttribute(Type sourceType, string name1, 
        params string[] moreNames);
DataSourceAttribute(string name1, params string[] moreNames);

// For CLS-Compliance
FactoriesAttribute(Type sourceType, string sourceName);
FactoriesAttribute(string sourceName);
</pre>
</div>

<p>If <b>sourceType</b> is specified, it represents the class that provides
the data. If not, the class containing the test method is used.

<p>Each <b>sourceName</b>, represents the name of a field, property or
method that will provide the arguments.

<p>Each individually named source has the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>It may be a field, property or method.
<li>It may be either an instance or a static member.
<li>It must be an IEnumerable or a type that implements IEnumerable.
</ul>

<p>NUnit locates the data sources at the time the tests are loaded, creates
instances of each class having non-static sources and builds a list of 
tests to be executed. Each instancet is only created once at this
time and is destroyed after all tests are loaded. In the case of sources
located within the same class as the tests, a different instance is created
each time the test is run, so no communication is possible using non-static
members of the class.
