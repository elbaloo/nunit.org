<h2>NUnit Addins</h2>

<p>NUnit originally identified tests in the time-honored way used in many xUnit
test frameworks. Test classes inherited from the framework's 
TestCase class. Individual test case methods were identified by having names
starting with "test..."</p>

<p>With NUnit 2.0, we introduced the use of attributes to identify both fixtures
and test cases. Use of attributes in this way was a natural outcome of their 
presence in .NET and gave us a way of identifying tests that was completely
independent of both inheritance and naming conventions.</p>

<p>However, by moving away from an inheritance-based mechanism we no longer
had an easy way for others to extend NUnit's internal behavior. NUnit Addins are 
intended to fill that gap, providing an mechanism to introduce new or changed 
behavior without modifying NUnit itself.</p>

<h3>Extension Points, Extensions and Addins</h3>

<p>NUnit provides a number of <b>Extension Points</b>, places where it is
possible to extend its behavior. Because NUnit works with various hosts
and uses separate AppDomains to run tests, <b>Extension Points</b> are 
categorized into three types: Core, Client and Gui. Each of these types is
supported by a different <b>Extension Host</b>.

<p>An NUnit <b>Addin</b> provides enhanced functionality through one or more 
extensions, which it installs at identified <b>Extension Points</b>. Each
<b>Addin</b> is characterized by the types of extensions it supplies, so that
an <b>Extension Host</b> knows whether to invoke it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> In the current release, only Core extensions are actually
supported. An Addin may characterize itself as a Client or Gui extension and
will be listed as such in the <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "addinsDialog", "Addins Dialog" ) ?>, 
but no other action is taken.</p>
</blockquote> 

<h3>Addin Identification, Loading and Installation</h3>

<p>NUnit examines all assemblies in the <b>bin/addins</b> directory, looking
for public classes with the <b>NUnitAddinAttribute</b> and implementing the
<b>IAddin</b> interface. It loads all those it finds as Addins.</p>

<p><b>NUnitAddinAttribute</b> supports three optional named parameters: Type,
Name and Description. Name and Description are strings representing the name
of the extension and a description of what it does. If no name is provided,
the name of the class is used. Type may be any one or a combination of the 
ExtensionType enum members:

<pre class="prettyprint">
	[Flags]
	public enum ExtensionType
	{
		Core=1,
		Client=2,
		Gui=4
	}
</pre>

The values may be or'ed together, allowing for future Addins that require
extensions at multiple levels of the application. If not provided, Type
defaults to ExtensionType.Core.</p>

<p>The <b>IAddin</b> interface, which must be implemented by each Addin,
is defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
	public interface IAddin
	{
		bool Install( IExtensionHost host );
	}
</pre>

<p> The <b>Install</b> method is called by each host for which the addin has
specified an ExtensionType. The addin should check that the necessary extension
points are available and install itself, returning true for success or false
for failure to install. The method will be called once for each extension
host and - for Core extensions - each time a new test domain is loaded.</p>

<p>The Install method uses the <b>IExtensionHost</b> interface to locate
extension points. It is defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
	public interface IExtensionHost
	{
	 	IExtensionPoint[] ExtensionPoints { get; }
		IExtensionPoint GetExtensionPoint( string name );
		ExtensionType ExtensionTypes { get; }
	}
</pre>

<p>The <b>ExtensionPoints</b> property returns an array of all extension points
for those extensions that need the information. The <b>ExtensionTypes</b>
property returns the flags for the type of extension supported by this host,
allowing, for example, Gui extensions to only load in a Gui host.</p>

<p>Most addins will only need to use the <b>GetExtensionPoint</b> method to
get the interface to a particular extension point. The <b>IExtensionPoint</b>
interface is defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
	public interface IExtensionPoint
	{
		string Name { get; }
		IExtensionHost Host { get; }
		void Install( object extension );
		void Remove( object extension );
	}
</pre>

<p>Once again, most addins will only need to use one method - the
<b>Install</b> method in this case. This method passes an extension object
to the <b>Extension Point</b> where it is installed. Generally, extensions
do not need to remove themselves once installed, but the method is
provided in any case.</p>

<p>With NUnit 2.5, an additional interface, <b>IExtensionPoint2</b> is
available. It derives from <b>IExtensionPoint</b> and also allows setting
the priority order in which the extension will be called in comparison to 
other extensions on the same extension point. The interface is defined
as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint">
	public interface IExtensionPoint2 : IExtensionPoint
	{
		void Install( object extension, int priority );
	}
</pre>

<p>Only extension points that use a priority scheme implement this interface.
In general, extension points with a priority scheme will use a default value
for priority if the Install method without a priority is called. 

<p>In the NUnit 2.5 release, only the <b>TestDecorators</b> extension point implements
<b>IExtensionPoint2</b>.

<h3>Extension Point Details</h3>

<p>Depending on the particular extension point, the object passed will
need to implement one or more interfaces. The following <b>ExtensionPoints</b>
are implemented in this release of NUnit:

<ul>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("suiteBuilders", "SuiteBuilders") ?>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("testcaseBuilders", "TestCaseBuilders") ?>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("testDecorators", "TestDecorators") ?>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("testcaseProviders", "TestCaseProviders") ?>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("datapointProviders", "DataPointProviders") ?>
	<li><?php echo nunit_doc_link("eventListeners", "EventListeners") ?>
</ul></p>

<p>For examples of implementing each type of extension, see the Extensibility
samples provided with NUnit. More complete examples are available in the
code of NUnit itself, since NUnit uses the same mechanism internally.</p>
