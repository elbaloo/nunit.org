<h3>TestDecorators (NUnit 2.4)</h3>

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>TestDecorators are able to modify a test after it has been constructed.

<h4>Extension Point</h4>
<p>Addins use the host to access this extension point by name:

<pre>
	IExtensionPoint testDecorators = host.GetExtensionPoint( "TestDecorators" );</pre>

<h4>Interface</h4>
<p>The extension object passed to Install must implement the ITestDecorator interface:

<pre>
	public interface ITestDecorator
	{
		Test Decorate( Test test, MemberInfo member );
	}
</pre>

<p>The Decorate method may do several things, depending on what it needs
to accomplish:
<ol>
  <li>Return test unmodified
  <li>Modify properties of the test object and return it
  <li>Replace test with another object, either discarding the
  original or aggregating it in the new test.
</ol>

<p>Depending on what the decorator does, it may need to run
ahead of other decorators or after them. Decorators should
be installed using the Install method overload that takes
a priority. The priorities range from 1 to 9 and decorators
with lower priority values are installed first. The following
standard values are defined for use if desired:
<ul>
<li>DecoratorPriority.Default = 0
<li>DecoratorPriority.First = 1
<li>DecoratorPriority.Normal = 5
<li>DecoratorPriority.Last = 9
</ul>
