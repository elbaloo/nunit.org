<h3>RequiredAddinAttribute (NUnit 2.5)</h3>

<p>The RequiredAddin attribute is used to indicate that an
   assembly requires a particular addin in order to function correctly. If
   that addin is not installed, the entire assembly is marked as non-runnable.
   
<p><b>Note:</b> In the Alpha-3 release, this attribute may be applied to
classes or methods as well. This is of limited utility, for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>If the method or class is not recognized as a test, due to the addin
being missing, then NUnit will never process it.
<li>If the method or class is handled by some a different addin, that
addin may not recognize the attribute.
</ol>
<p>The attribute will be limited to assemblies only in the next release.

<In the 

<div class="code"><pre>
