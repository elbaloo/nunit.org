<h3>ValueSourceAttribute (NUnit 2.5)</h3>

<p><b>ValueSourceAttribute</b> is used on individual parameters of a test method to
identify a named source for the argument values to be supplied. The attribute has 
two public constructors.

<div class="code">
<pre>
ValueSourceAttribute(Type sourceType, string sourceName);
ValueSourceAttribute(string sourceName);
</pre>
</div>

<p>If <b>sourceType</b> is specified, it represents the class that provides
the data. It must have a default constructor.

<p>If <b>sourceType</b> is not specified, the class containing the test
method is used. NUnit will construct it using either the default constructor
or - if arguments are provided - the appropriate constructor for those 
arguments.

<p>The <b>sourceName</b>, represents the name of the source that will 
provide the arguments. It should have the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>It may be a field, a non-indexed property or a method taking no arguments.
<li>It may be either an instance or a static member.
<li>It must return an IEnumerable or a type that implements IEnumerable.
<li>The individual items returned from the enumerator must be compatible
    with the type of the parameter on which the attribute appears.
</ul>

<p>NUnit locates value sources at the time the tests are loaded, creates
instances of each class having non-static sources and builds a list of 
tests to be executed. Each instance is only created once at this
time and is destroyed after all tests are loaded. In the case of sources
located within the same class as the tests, a different instance is created
each time the test is run, so no communication is possible using non-static
members of the class.
