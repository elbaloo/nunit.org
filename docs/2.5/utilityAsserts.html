<h2>Utility Methods</h2>
<p>Four utility methods, <b>Pass()</b>, <b>Fail()</b>, <b>Ignore()</b> and <b>Inconclusive()</b> are provided 
   in order to allow more direct control of the test process:</p>
<div class="code" style="width: 36em"><pre class="prettyprint">
Assert.Pass();
Assert.Pass( string message );
Assert.Pass( string message, object[] parms );

Assert.Fail();
Assert.Fail( string message );
Assert.Fail( string message, object[] parms );

Assert.Ignore();
Assert.Ignore( string message );
Assert.Ignore( string message, object[] parms );

Assert.Inconclusive();
Assert.Inconclusive( string message );
Assert.Inconclusive( string message, object[] parms );</pre>
</div>
<p>The <b>Assert.Pass</b> method allows you to immediately end the test, recording
	it as successful. Since it causes an exception to be thrown, it is more
	efficient to simply allow the test to return. However, Assert.Pass allows 
	you to record a message in the test result and may also make the test
	easier to read in some situations. Additionally, like the other methods
	on this page, it can be invoked from a nested method call with the
	result of immediately terminating test execution.</p>
<p>The <b>Assert.Fail</b> method provides you with the ability to generate a failure based 
	on tests that are not encapsulated by the other methods. It is also useful in 
	developing your own project-specific assertions.</p>
<p>Here's an example of its use to create a private assertion that tests whether a 
	string contains an expected value.</p>
<div class="code" style="width: 36em">
	<pre class="prettyprint">public void AssertStringContains( string expected, string actual )
{
    AssertStringContains( expected, actual, string.Empty );
}

public void AssertStringContains( string expected, string actual,
    string message )
{
    if ( actual.IndexOf( expected ) < 0 )
        Assert.Fail( message );
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The <b>Assert.Ignore</b> method provides you with the ability to dynamically cause a 
	test or suite to be ignored at runtime. It may be called in a test, setup or 
	fixture setup method. We recommend that you use this only in isolated cases. 
	The category facility is provided for more extensive inclusion or exclusion of 
	tests or you may elect to simply divide tests run on different occasions into 
	different assemblies.</p>
<p>The <b>Assert.Inconclusive</b> method indicates that the test could not be
   completed with the data available. It should be used in situations where 
   another run with different data might run to completion, with either a
   success or failure outcome.
