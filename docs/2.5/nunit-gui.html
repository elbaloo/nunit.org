<h2>NUnit Gui Runner</h2>
<p>The nunit.exe program is a graphical runner. It shows the tests in an 
	explorer-like browser window and provides a visual indication of the success or 
	failure of the tests. It allows you to selectively run single tests or suites 
	and reloads automatically as you modify and re-compile your code. The following 
	is a screenshot of NUnit running the same mock-assembly.dll shown in the 
	nunit-console example.</p>

<h4>Tree Display</h4>
<p>This version of NUnit uses symbols in the test tree, which allow those who 
   are unable to easily distinguish colors to determine the test status.
   Successful tests are colored green, with a check mark. Tests that are ignored 
   are marked with a yellow circle, containing a question mark. If any
   tests had failed, they would be marked red, with an X symbol.</p>

<p>In this example, there were a total of 11 test cases, but one of them was not 
   counted because it was marked Explicit. Note that it is shown as a gray
   circle in the tree. Of the remaining 10 tests, 5 were run successfully and
   5 were ignored.</p>
   
<p>The symbols shown in the tree are actually files in the NUnit bin directory.
   These files are named Success.jpg, Failure.jpg and Ignored.jpg and may be
   modified or replaced by the user.</p>
   
<h4>Progress Bar</h4>
<p>The progress bar shows the progress of the test. It is colored according
to the "worst" result obtained: red if there were any failures, yellow if
some tests were ignored and green for success.

<h4>Result Tabs</h4>
<p>The tabs along the bottom of the display show the results of running
a test. The <b>Errors and Failures</b> tab displays the error message
and stack trace for both unexpected exceptions and assertion failures.
Beginning with NUnit 2.5, source code for each stack location can be displayed
in this tab - as is seen above - provided that the program was compiled with 
debug information.

<p>The <b>Tests Not Run</b> tab provides a list of all tests that were
selected for running but were not run, together with the reason.

<p>The Text Output tab displays text output from the tests, potentially
including console output, trace output and log output. The default display
provides a single tab, but additional tabs may be created by the user to
hold specific kinds of output. For more information on creating new tabs, 
see the documentation for the 
<?php echo nunit_doc_link("settingsDialog", "Settings Dialog") ?>.
   

<h3>Mini-Gui</h3>

<p>Since the release of NUnit 2.4, an alternate "mini-gui" is also available. It 
   may be selected from the View menu. In the following screenshot, the mini
   gui window has been positioned next to the Visual Studio IDE so
   that both windows can be seen.</p>
