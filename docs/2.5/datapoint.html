<h3>DatapointAttribute / DatapointsAttribute (NUnit 2.5) (Experimental)</h3>

<p>The <b>Datapoint</b> and <b>Datapoints</b> attributes are used
   to provide data for <b>Theories</b> and are ignored for ordinary
   tests - including tests with parameters.
   
<p>When a Theory is loaded, NUnit creates arguments for each
   of its parameters by using any fields of the same type
   as the parameter annotated with the <b>DatapointAttribute</b>.
   In addition, elements of arrays of the required type
   annotated with the <b>DatapointsAttribute</b> are also used.
   
<p><b>Note:</b> In the current release, these attributes are only recognized
   when used exactly as specified above. In particular, they may not be used
   on methods or properties and the <b>DatapointsAttribute</b> may only be
   placed on an array. These limitations will be removed in a later release.
   
<p>For an example of use, see <?php echo nunit_doc_link("theory", "TheoryAttribute" ); ?>.
