<h3>TheoryAttribute (NUnit 2.5) (Experimental)</h3>

<p>A Theory is a special type of test, used to verify a general
   statement about the system under development. Normal tests are
   <em>example-based</em>. That is, the developer supplies one or
   more examples of inputs and expected outputs either within the
   code of the test or - in the case of
   <?php echo nunit_doc_link("parameterizedTests", "Parameterized Tests" ) ?> 
   - as arguments to the test method. A theory, on the other hand,
   makes a general statement that all of its assertions will pass
   for all arguments satisfying certain assumptions.
   
<p>Theories are implemented in NUnit
   as methods within a <b>TestFixture</b>, which are annotated
   with the <b>TheoryAttribute</b>. Theory methods must always have 
   arguments and therefore appears quite similar to 
   <?php echo nunit_doc_link("parameterizedTests", "Parameterized Tests" ) ?>
   at first glance. However, a Theory incorporates additional data sources 
   for its arguments and allows special processing for assumptions
   about that data. The key difference, though, is that theories
   make general statements and are more than just a set of examples.
   
<h4>Data for Theories</h4>

<p>The primary source of data for a <b>Theory</b> is the
   <?php echo nunit_doc_link("datapoint", "<b>Datapoint</b> or <b>Datapoints</b> attribute") ?>. 
   NUnit will use any fields of the required types, which are annotated
   with one of these attributes, to provide data for each parameter
   of the Theory. NUnit assembles the values for individual arguments 
   combinatorially to provide test cases for the theory.
   
<p>In addition to the Datapoint and Datapoints attributes, it
   is possible to use any of the approaches for supplying data
   that are recognized on normal parameterized tests. We suggest
   that this capability not be overused, since it runs counter
   to the distinction between a test based on examples and a
   theory. However, it may be useful in order to guarantee that
   a specific test case is included.
   
<h4>Assumptions</h4>

<p>The theory itself is responsible for ensuring that all data supplied
   meets its assumptions. It does this by use of the
   <b>Assume.That(...)</b> construct, which works just like
   <b>Assert.That(...)</b> but does not cause a failure. If
   the assumption is not satisfied for a particular test case, that case
   returns an Inconclusive result, rather than a Success or Failure. 
   
<p>The overall result of executing a Theory over a set of test cases is 
   determined as follows:
   
   <ul>
   <li>If the assumptions are violated for <b>all</b> test cases, then the
       Theory itself is marked as a failure.
   
   <li>If any Assertion fails, the Theory itself fails.
   
   <li>If at least <b>some</b> cases pass the stated assumptions, and 
       there are <b>no</b> assertion failures or exceptions, then the
	   Theory passes.
   </ul>
   
<h4>Example:</h4>

<p>In the following example, the theory SquareRootDefinition
   verifies that the implementation of square root satisies
   the following definition:
   
<p style="margin: 2em"><i>
"Given a non-negative number, the square root of that number
 is always non-negative and, when multiplied by itself, gives 
 the original number."</i>

<div class="code" style="width: 36em">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class SqrtTests
{
    [Datapoint]
    public double zero = 0;

    [Datapoint]
    public double positive = 1;

    [Datapoint]
    public double negative = -1;

    [Datapoint]
    public double max = double.MaxValue;

    [Datapoint]
    public double infinity = double.PositiveInfinity;

    [Theory]
    public void SquareRootDefinition(double num)
    {
        Assume.That(num >= 0.0 && num < double.MaxValue);

        double sqrt = Math.Sqrt(num);

        Assert.That(sqrt >= 0.0);
        Assert.That(sqrt * sqrt, Is.EqualTo(num).Within(0.000001));
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
