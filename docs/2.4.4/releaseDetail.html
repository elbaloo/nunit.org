<h3>NUnit 2.4.4 - October 20, 2007</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now uses log4net rather than Trace for its own internal logging. If
enabled by the NUnit config files, log entries are saved in the file NUnit.log
located in the Application Data directory.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> Using the supplied config file, log4net currently fails to create 
the log file when running under Mono on Windows platforms. As a workaround, you
may edit the configs to use a hardcoded path in place of the $(APPDATA) macro.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>A suite marked with the SuiteAttribute is now permitted to return a collection
of fixture objects or Types, rather than a TestSuite. This eliminates the need
for the tests to reference the nunit.core assembly.
<li>Classes containing suites may now use the TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown
attributes to decorate methods to be called for one-time setup and teardown.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> This feature has actually been in place since the 2.4 release, but
was not previously reported in the release notes.

<li>It is now possible to specify a TimeSpan as a tolerance when comparing
two DateTime objects for equality.

<li>Tests may now set a default tolerance for floating point comparisons may now 
be set using <b>GlobalSettings.DefaultFloatingPointTolerance</b>. If not set, a 
tolerance of 0.0d is used for backward compatibility.

<li>String comparison failures now show more context than before, using the
full width of the message line. The length of the message line defaults to 78
but may be changed by setting <b>TextMessageWriter.MaxLineLength</b>. Set it to an
arbitrarily high value to avoid all string truncation. Use the <b>NoClip</b>
modifier on an equality constraint to prevent clipping on an individual
assert.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>Cosmetic changes have been made to the main Gui window and the tabbed Options
dialog has  been replaced with a tree-based dialog in order to allow more
opportunity for expanded options.

<li>User logging through log4net is captured and displayed by the Gui.

<li>A new Test Output Options pane allows controlling exactly what appears in 
each text window. By default, NUnit uses four tabs: StdOut, StdErr, Trace and 
Log, but the user may remove, create or combine tabs as desired.

<li>A new command-line option <b>/console</b> causes a console to be 
allocated. This should be used when testing applications that used unmanaged
APIs to write to stdout, since NUnit is not able to capture that output.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>

<li>A new <b>ExtensionPoint</b> has been added. The <b>Listeners</b> extension
point allows an addin to install an <b>EventListener</b> in the test domain,
which is called as the tests are run. Note that the call is asynchronous and
therefore may not be used to control the running of the tests, but only to
report information or take other action based on the events.

<li>The implementation of NUnitTestFixture has been modified so that
it is now possible to write a TestCaseBuilder addin, which will replace
or enhance the builtin creation of TestCases.

</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul> 
<li>The ability to select and copy text from the text output windows, which
was unintentionally dropped in NUnit 2.4.3, has been restored.
<li>The programs nunit-console-x86.exe and nunit-x86.exe are now being installed
correctly by the .NET 2.0 Windows installer package.
<li>Checked tests are now ignored when the checkboxes are hidden.
<li>Fixed a problem loading assemblies with multiple # characters in the path
<li>Tests are no longer executed twice with certain combinations of reload/rerun settings
<li>Obsolete /framework option is no longer displayed by the console runner help
<li>The console runner now accepts both /include and /exclude options
<li>The Gui "loading" and "reloading" notices are now sized correctly under Mono
<li>Trace output, which was disabled in 2.4.3, is now displayed correctly.
<li>The exception message is now displayed when the wrong exception type is received from a testcase marked with ExpectedException
<li>The EmptyCollection constraint now throws an exception if applied to a null reference rather than returning false
<li>Reloading a single assembly no longer changes the config file name 
<li>Changing options without a loaded project no longer gives an exception
<li>The Show Checkboxes entry on the tree context menu now works correctly.
<li>All levels of teardown now run when an exception is thrown
</ul>
