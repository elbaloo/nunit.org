<h2>Comparison Constraints (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>Comparison constraints are able to test whether one value
is greater or less than another. Comparison constraints work
on numeric values, as well as other objects that implement IComparable.

<table class="constraints">
<tr><th>Syntax Helper</th><th>Constructor</th><th>Operation</th></tr>
<tr><td>Is.GreaterThan( IComparable )</td><td>GreaterThanConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is greater than another</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is.GreaterThanOrEqualTo( IComparable )</td><td>GreaterThanOrEqualConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is greater than or equal to another</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is.AtLeast( IComparable )</td><td>GreaterThanOrEqualConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is greater than or equal to another</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is.LessThan( IComparable )</td><td>LessThanConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is less than another</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is.LessThanOrEqualTo( IComparable )</td><td>LessThanOrEqualConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is less than or equal to another</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is.AtMost( IComparable )</td><td>LessThanOrEqualConstraint( IComparable )</td></td><td>tests that one value is less than or equal to another</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Examples of Use</h4>

<div class="code"><pre class="prettyprint">
Assert.That(7, Is.GreaterThan(3));
Assert.That(7, Is.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(3));
Assert.That(7, Is.AtLeast(3));
Assert.That(7, Is.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(7));
Assert.That(7, Is.AtLeast(7));

Assert.That(3, Is.LessThan(7));
Assert.That(3, Is.LessThanOrEqualTo(7));
Assert.That(3, Is.AtMost(7));
Assert.That(3, Is.LessThanOrEqualTo(3));
Assert.That(3, Is.AtMost(3));

// Using Inheritance
Expect( 7, GreaterThan(3));
Expect( 3, AtMost(7));
</pre></div>
