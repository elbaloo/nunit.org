<h2>Equal Constraint (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>An EqualConstraint is used to test whether an actual value
   is equal to the expected value supplied in its constructor.

<table class="constraints">
<tr><th>Syntax Helper</th><th>Constructor</th><th>Operation</th></tr>
<tr><td>Is.EqualTo( object )</td><td>EqualConstraint( null )</td></td><td>tests that two objects are equal</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Numerics of different types compare successfully if their values are equal.
<li>Values of type float and double are normally compared using an additional
argument that indicates a tolerance within which they will be considered 
as equal. The Within modifier is used for this purpose. It is accepted
but ignored on comparisons other than float or double.
<li>Unlike normal floating point arithmetic, floating NaN comparisons succeed
    if both values are NaN. See the note on 
	 nunit_doc_link( "equalityAsserts", "Equality Asserts" ).
<li>You may use this constraint to compare arrays with the same number of dimensions,
   two collections or an single-dimensioned array and collection. If you want to 
   treat the arrays being compared as simple collections, use the AsCollection
   modifier, which causes the comparison to be made element by element, without
   regard for the rank or dimensions of the array. Jagged arrays (arrays of arrays)
   are compared recursively and must match in shape exactly for the comparison
   to succeed.
<li>In order to assert that two strings are equal ignoring case, use the IgnoreCase
modifier. It may also be used when comparing arrays or collections of strings.
</ol>

<h4>Examples of Use</h4>
