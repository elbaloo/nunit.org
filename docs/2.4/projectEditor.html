<h2>Project Editor</h2>

<p>The Project Editor is displayed through the Project | Edit menu item and allows creating or
modifying NUnit test projects. It should be noted that a Test Project is active whenever any tests
have been loaded, even if no project was explicitly created or referenced. In the case of an
assembly being loaded, an internal wrapper project is created. This allows the user to change
settings and save the project directly without needing to perform any extra steps. The editor
consists of a common area and two tabs, as seen in the image below.</p>

<h3>Common Area</h3>

<p>The common area of the Project Editor contains a label showing the full path 
   to the project file. There is an edit box, allowing the user to change
   the project AppBase, which defaults to the directory of the project file.
   There is also a dropdown combo box permitting selection of the configuration 
   to be edited and a button, which opens the 
    nunit_doc_link( "configEditor", "Configuration Editor" ).</p>

<h3>General Tab</h3>

<p>The General tab allows setting a number of options pertaining to the selected configuration, all of
which will be stored in the NUnit project file as attributes of the <config> xml node.</p>

<h4>ApplicationBase</h4>
<p>The ApplicationBase defaults to the directory containing the project file. Beginning
with NUnit 2.2.3, it may be set to any location that is desired.</p>

<h4>Configuration File Name</h4>
<p>The configuration file defaults to the name of the test project with the extension changed
from .nunit to .config. The user may substitute another name.</p>

<h4>PrivateBinPath</h4>
<p>By default, the PrivateBinPath is generated from the assembly locations specified on the
Assemblies Tab. For those applications requiring a different level of control, it may be
specified manually or using this editor or placed in the configuration file.</p>

<h3>Assemblies Tab</h3>

<p>The assemblies tab contains the list of assemblies that form part of this test project.</p>

<p>Note: Although the dialog shows the location of assemblies as absolute paths, they are always
persisted in the NUnit project file as paths relative to the application base. This allows moving
projects as a whole to a different directory location.</p>
