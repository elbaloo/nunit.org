<h2>Assertions</h2>

<p>Assertions are central to unit testing in any of the xUnit frameworks, and NUnit 
	is no exception. NUnit provides a rich set of assertions as static methods of 
	the Assert class.</p>

<p>If an assertion fails, the method call does not return and an error is reported. 
	If a test contains multiple assertions, any that follow the one that failed 
	will not be executed. For this reason, it's usually best to try for one 
	assertion per test.</p>

<p>Each method may be called without a message, with a simple text message or with 
	a message and arguments. In the last case the message is formatted using the 
	provided text and arguments.</p>
	
<h3>Two Models</h3>

<p>Before NUnit 2.4, a separate method of the Assert class was used for each
   different assertion. We call this the 
    nunit_doc_link( "classicModel", "classic model" ). It
   continues to be supported in NUnit, since many people prefer it.</p>

<p>Beginning with NUnit 2.4, a new 
    nunit_doc_link( "constraintModel", "constraint-based model" ) is being 
   introduced. This approach uses a single method of the Assert class
   for all assertions, passing a <b>constraint</b> object that specifies the
   test to be performed.

<p>This constraint-based model is now used internally by NUnit
   for all assertions. The methods of the classic approach have been 
   re-implemented on top of this new model.
