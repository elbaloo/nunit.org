<h2>Test Properties Dialog</h2>

<p>The test properties dialog is displayed using either the View | Properties menu item on the main
menu or the Properties item on the context menu. It shows information about the test and – if it
has been run – about the results. The dialog contains a “pin” button in the upper right corner,
which causes it to remain open as the user clicks on different tests.</p>
