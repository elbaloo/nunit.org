<h2>Options Dialog</h2>

<p>The Options Dialog is displayed using the Tools | Options menu item and allows the user to
control some aspects of NUnit’s operation:</p>

</div>

<h3>Recent Files</h3>

<p>The text box allows the user to choose the number of entries to display in the recent files list.
If “Load most recent project at startup” is checked, the GUI will load the last file opened unless it
is run with a specific filename or with the <code>/noload</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The list box allows selecting the degree of expansion of the tree when tests are loaded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Expand</b> – expands all tests</p>
<p><b>Collapse</b> – collapses all tests</p>
<p><b>Hide Tests</b> – expands all suites except for the fixtures themselves.</p>
<p><b>Auto</b> – selects one of the above based on the space available for the tree display.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Assembly Reload</h3>

<p>If “Reload before each test run” is checked, a reload will occur whenever the run button is
pressed whether the assemblies appear to have changed or not.</p>

<p>If “Reload when test assembly changes” is checked, assemblies are watched for any change and
an automatic reload is initiated. This item is disabled on Windows 98 or ME.</p>

<p>If “Clear results when tests change” is checked, an automatic or manual reload will reinitialize all
test nodes in the tree (grey display) – if it is not checked, result information for tests that do
not seem to have changed will be retained.</p>

<h3>Test Output</h3>

<p>Check this to precede text in the output window with the name of the test that produced it.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio</h3>

<p>If “Enable Visual Studio Support”is checked, the user will be able to open Visual Studio projects
and solutions and add Visual Studio projects to existing test projects.</p>
