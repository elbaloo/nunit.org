<h2>Getting Started with NUnit</h2>

<p>If you haven't already done so, go to our  nunit_link( "download", "Download" )
	page, select a version of NUnit and download it. The 
	 nunit_doc_link( "installation", "Installation" ) page 
	contains instructions for installing on your system.</p>

<p>To get started using NUnit, read the  nunit_doc_link( "quickStart", "Quick Start" )
	page. This article demonstrates the development process with NUnit in the 
	context of a C# banking application. Check the 
	 nunit_doc_link( "samples", "Samples" ) page for additional examples, 
	including some in VB.Net, J# and managed C++.</p>

<h3>Which Test Runner to use?</h3>

<p>NUnit has two different ways to run your tests. The 
	 nunit_doc_link( "nunit-console", "console runner" ), nunit-console.exe, 
	is the fastest to launch, but is not interactive. 
 	The  nunit_doc_link( "nunit-gui", "gui runner" ), 
	nunit-gui.exe, is a Windows Forms application that allows you to work 
	selectively with your tests and provides graphical feedback.</p>
