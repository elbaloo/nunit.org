<h2>NUnit-Gui</h2>
<p>The nunit-gui.exe program is a graphical runner. It shows the tests in an 
	explorer-like browser window and provides a visual indication of the success or 
	failure of the tests. It allows you to selectively run single tests or suites 
	and reloads automatically as you modify and re-compile your code. The following 
	is a screenshot of nunit-gui running the same mock-assembly.dll shown in the 
	previous example.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
     <?php echo nunit_doc_img( "gui-screenshot.gif" ) ?>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the tests that were not run are marked with a yellow circle, 
	while those that were run successfully are colored green. If any tests had 
	failed, they would be marked red.</p>
