<h2>Test Properties Dialog</h2>

<p>The test properties dialog is displayed using either the View | Properties menu item on the main
menu or the Properties item on the context menu. It shows information about the test and – if it
has been run – about the results. The dialog contains a “pin” button in the upper right corner,
which causes it to remain open as the user clicks on different tests.</p>

<h3>Test Tab</h3>

<p>This tab gives general information about the test itself.</p>

<h4>Full Name</h4>
<p>The fully qualified name of the test. In the image below, a tooltip is displaying the complete
name, which did not fit in the label.</p>

<h4>Test Count</h4>
<p>The number of test cases contained directly or indirectly in this test.</p>

<h4>Runnable?</h4>
<p>Indicates whether the test can be run or not.</p>

<h4>Reason</h4>
<p>If the test is not Runnable, indicates the reason. This can be the reason given on an ignore
attribute or an error such as trying to apply the Test attribute to a private method.</p>
