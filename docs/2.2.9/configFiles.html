<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

<p>NUnit uses configuration files for the test runner executable – either nunit-console.exe or
nunitgui.exe – as well as for the tests being run. Only settings that pertain to NUnit itself should be in
the nunit-console.exe.config and nunit-gui.exe.config, while those that pertain to your own
application and tests should be in a separate configuration file.</p>

<h3>NUnit Configuration Files</h3>

<p>One main purpose of the nunit-console and nunit-gui config files is to allow 
NUnit to run with various versions of the .NET framework. NUnit is built using
versions 1.1 and 2.0 of the framework. The two builds are provided as separate
downloads and either build can be made to run against other versions of the CLR.</p>
 
<p>As delivered, the <startup> section of each config file is commented out,
causing NUnit to run with the version of .NET used to build it. If you uncomment 
the <startup> section, the entries there control the order in which alternate 
framework versions are selected.</p>

<h3>Test Configuration File</h3>

<p>When a configuration file is used to provide settings or to control the environment in which a test
is run, specific naming conventions must be followed.</p>

<p>If a single assembly is being loaded, then the configuration file is given the name of the assembly
file with the config extension. For example, the configuration file used to run nunit.tests.dll must
be named nunit.tests.dll.config and located in the same directory as the dll.</p>

<p>If an NUnit project is being loaded, the configuration file uses the name of the project file with
the extension <i>changed</i> to config. For example, the project AllTests.nunit would require a
configuration file named AllTests.config, located in the same directory as AllTests.nunit. The
same rule is followed when loading Visual Studio projects or solutions.</p>

<p>Generally, you should be able to simply copy your application config file and rename it as
described above. However, see the next section if you wish to run tests compiled for an earlier
version of NUnit.</p>
