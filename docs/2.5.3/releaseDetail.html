<h3>NUnit 2.5.3 - Version 2.5.3.9345 - December 11, 2009</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is the first release of NUnit on Launchpad.
   
<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Test execution under .NET 4.0 is now supported. It may be selected
    in the Gui runner or using the console runner /framework option.
	NUnit test projects may specify .NET 4.0 as the required framework
	to be used for loading the the project. PlatformAttribute allows 
	testing for .NET 4.0.
<li>The distribution now includes nunit-agent-x86.exe, which is used
    for running tests in a separate process under nunit-x86.exe
	or nunit-console-x86.exe when the target framework is .NET 2.0
	or greater.
<li>Static methods Contains.Substring() and Contains.Item() have been
    added to the NUnit syntax for compatibility with NUnitLite.
<li>Non-public test fixtures are now allowed in all cases, 
    whether the TestFixtureAttribute is present or not.
<li>Abstract classes may now be marked with TestFixtureAttribute
    to indicate that derived classes are to be treated as 
	test fixtures. The abstract class is no longer marked as invalid.
<li>Fixtures without tests are no longer shown as non-runnable but
    are simply executed. If the fixture setup or teardown does not cause
	an error, they are reported as inconclusive.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reloading tests in the Gui no longer uses the default runtime if
    a different runtime was previously selected.
<li>Thread principal is now saved before each test and restored afterward
    eliminating failures under .NET 4.0.
<li>Assume.That() overload with a message no longer results in test failure.
<li>An expected Result of null is now handled correctly on parameterized tests.
<li>Duplicate caching of metadata has been eliminated, resolving a
    load performance problem when many methods are inherited from
	a base class.
<li>The names of nested generic and non-generic classes are now displayed 
    correctly.
<li>Assert.Catch&lt;T&gt; now correctly returns exception type T rather than
    System.Exception.
<li>ValueSourceAttribute now works correctly when used with an external type.
<li>The /domain=None option on nunit-console once again works correctly.
<li>Parameterized test fixture names are now displayed with the actual
    arguments used so that failures may be associated with the correct
	instantiation of the fixture.
<li>Test labels for generics are now displayed correctly by the console
    runner and in the Gui text output tab.
<li>Generic fixtures without type attributes provided are now shown
    as non-runnable rather than causing a runtime error. (1)
<li>Use of an unknown file type in the console command line no longer causes
    an error. (2)
<li>A number of tests that ran incorrectly under Linux have been fixed.
<li>A number of tests failing under .NET 4.0 have been fixed.
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>As a side effect of this fix, TestFixtureAttribute on a base class is
    overridden by a TestFixtureAttribute on the derived class. 
<li>This was originally reported as "crash when using /option in linux."
</ol>
