<h2>NUnit Extensibility</h2>

<p>NUnit is designed to be extended in a number of ways.</p>

<p>Extensions to the NUnit framework - the part of NUnit that is referenced
by tests - usually take the form of 
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "customAsserts", "Custom Asserts" ) ?>, written by users to 
encapsulate tests that pertain to their specific projects.</p>

<p>Extending the features found within NUnit itself depends on the use of
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "nunitAddins", "NUnit Addins" ) ?>. 
Currently, The Addin mechanism only supports extensions to the NUnit core -
the part of NUnit that builds and executes test suites. However, the API that
is used provides for the future ability to extend the client side of NUnit, 
including the GUI.</p>
