<h3>NUnit 2.4.7 - March 30, 2008</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit no longer uses log4net for its internal logging,
eliminating conflicts with tested applications that used
an earlier version of log4net.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The level of logging sent to the gui for display is
now controlled by a setting in the config file for each
test. If no setting is provided, the default value is Error. 
See the NUnitTests.config file for an example of how to set this.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit now includes the <b>RowTest</b> extension, written by
Andreas Schlapsi, in it's extension assemblies. This extension 
allows you to write
test methods that take arguments and to provide multiple sets 
of argument values using the <b>RowAttribute</b>. To use <b>RowTest</b>,
your test must reference the nunit.framework.extensions assembly.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> Merging extensions into NUnit's own extension assembly 
is an experiment we are trying for this release. The approach may
change in future releases.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed null reference exception in SimpleSettingsDialog
<li>String equality comparisons now use Equals rather than
String.Compare, which was causing some unexpected results.
<li>Fixed a race condition in the EventPump
<li>Exceptions in Dispose are now handled properly
<li>Projects in directories for which the user does not
have write access are closed correctly.
<li>The Reload command is now disabled when no project
is open, eliminating a crashing problem.
<li>Visual Studio projects with platforms other than
Any CPU may now be opened correctly.
<li>Assemblies located on a UNC path now load correctly
<li>The EventListeners extension point is correctly initialized
<li>Has.None no longer causes a null reference exception
<li>Use of log4net for internal logging has been eliminated
due to performance and compatibility problems.
</ul>
