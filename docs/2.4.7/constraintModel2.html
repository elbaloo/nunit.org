<h2>Constraint-Based Assert Model (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>The constraint-based Assert model uses a single method of the Assert class
   for all assertions. The logic necessary to carry out each assertion is
   embedded in the constraint object passed as the second parameter to that
   method.
   
<p>Here's a very simple assert using the constraint model:
<pre class="prettyprint">      Assert.That( myString, Is.EqualTo("Hello") );</pre>

<p>The second argument in this assertion uses one of NUnit's 
nunit_doc_link( "syntaxHelpers", "Syntax&nbsp;Helpers" ) to
create an <b>EqualConstraint</b>, one of the
nunit_doc_link( "constraintClasses", "Constraint&nbsp;Classes" ) provided
NUnit. The same assertion could also be made in this form:
<pre class="prettyprint">      Assert.That( myString, new EqualConstraint("Hello") );</pre>

<p>Test fixture classes inheriting from <b>AssertionHelper</b>
are able to use shorter forms. In such a class, the example above could
be expressed as:
<pre class="prettyprint">      Expect( myString, EqualTo("Hello" ) );</pre>

<p>The general form of   
<p><b>See also:</b> the 
nunit_doc_link( "classicModel", "classic model" ) of assertions.
