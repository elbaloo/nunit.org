<h2>Other Features</h2>

<p>If your application stores settings in <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "configFiles", "Configuration Files" ) ?>,
NUnit provides you with the ability to have settings for your test, which are different
from those used in production.</p>

<p>In addition to running tests in a single assembly, NUnit provides support for tests
organized as <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "Multiple Assemblies" ) ?> and for
creating and running tests as <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "NUnit Test Projects" ) ?>.

<p>For those using NUnit on a Windows system with Visual Studio installed, 
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "vsSupport", "Visual Studio Support" ) ?> is available.
