NUnit provides you with the ability to have settings for your test, which are different
from those used in production.</p>

<p>In addition to running tests in a single assembly, NUnit provides support for tests
organized as  nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "Multiple Assemblies" ) and for
creating and running tests as  nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "NUnit Test Projects" ).

<p>For those using NUnit on a Windows system with Visual Studio installed,
