<h3>NUnit 2.6.2 - Version 2.6.2.12296 - October 22, 2012</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tests may now be loaded and run from a shared directory specified as a UNC path.
<li>Tests may now be run under .NET 4.5.
<li>When running under a debugger, any nunit-agent process launched will break and allow the option to continue debugging the agent process as well.
<li>J# and old-style managed C++ samples have been removed. F# samples are now included. Code samples are no longer included in the standard installs but are available as a separate download. All samples now use VS2010 projects.
</ul>

<h4>Development</h4>
<ul>
<li>The source code now includes solutions for VS2010 and VS2012. The VS2008 solution has been removed.
<li>The NAnt build now uses NAnt 0.92.
<li>NSubstitute has been upgraded to version 1.4.3.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>When running under .NET 4.5, <b>async</b> test methods are now supported. For test cases returning a value, the method must return <b>Task&lt;T&gt;</b>, where <b>T</b> is the type of the returned value. For single tests and test cases not returning a value, the method may return either <b>void</b> or <b>Task</b>.
<li>The <b>Platform</b> attribute has been upgraded to recognize .NET 4.5, MaxOsX and XBox.
<li><b>TestCaseSource</b> may now specify a class that implements <b>IEnumerable</b> without specifying the name of a method.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>
<ul>
<li>New options <b>/basepath</b> and <b>/privatebinpath</b> allow specifying the ApplicationBase and probing path on the command line.
</ul>
