<h2>Assertions</h2>

<p>Assertions are central to unit testing in any of the xUnit frameworks, and NUnit 
	is no exception. NUnit provides a rich set of assertions as static methods of 
	the Assert class.</p>

<p>If an assertion fails, the method call does not return and an error is reported. 
	If a test contains multiple assertions, any that follow the one that failed 
	will not be executed. For this reason, it's usually best to try for one 
	assertion per test.</p>

<p>Each method may be called without a message, with a simple text message or with 
	a message and arguments. In the last case the message is formatted using the 
	provided text and arguments.</p>

<p>For convenience of presentation, we list the available assertions in three
	groups:  nunit_doc_link( "comparisonAsserts", "comparisons" ), single 
       nunit_doc_link( "conditionAsserts", "condition tests" ) and 
       nunit_doc_link( "utilityAsserts", "utility methods" ).</p>
