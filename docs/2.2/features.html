<h2>NUnit Features</h2>

<p>In order to test an application under NUnit, you write test code that is
specially annotated using custom  nunit_doc_link( "attributes", "Attributes" ).
Your test code contains  nunit_doc_link( "assertions", "Assertions" ), which
demonstrate the correct working of the application.</p>

<p>If your application stores settings in  nunit_doc_link( "configFiles", "Configuration Files" ),
NUnit provides you with the ability to have settings for your test, which are different
from those used in production.</p>

<p>In addition to running tests in a single assembly, NUnit provides support for tests
organized as  nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "Multiple Assemblies" ) and for
creating and running tests as  nunit_doc_link( "multiAssembly", "NUnit Test Projects" ).

<p>For those using NUnit on a Windows system with Visual Studio installed, 
 nunit_doc_link( "vsSupport", "Visual Studio Support" ) is available.
