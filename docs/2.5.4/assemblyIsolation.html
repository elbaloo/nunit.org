<h3>Assembly Isolation</h3>

<p>NUnit isolates test assemblies from its own code and from one another
   by use of separate AppDomains and/or Processes.
   
<p>By default, NUnit loads a test assembly into a separate <b>AppDomain</b>, 
   while its own code runs in the primary <b>AppDomain</b>.
   
<p>When multiple assemblies are run at the same time, NUnit loads them differently 
   depending on how they were specified. For assemblies that are part of an
   NUnit project, then a single <b>AppDomain</b> is used. If the assemblies 
   were specified on the console runner command line, then a separate 
   <b>AppDomain</b> is used for each of them.
   
<p>If greater separation is desired, test assemblies may be loaded into
   a separate <b>Process</b> or into multiple processes. This is done
   automatically by NUnit in the case where the tests are to be run under
   a different runtime from the one that NUnit is currently using.
   
<h3>Controlling Isolation</h3>

<p>Beyond the NUnit default behavior, the user may control the level of isolation
   through the command line or through NUnit's general settings. Process and AppDomain
   isolation may also be specified as part of the settings of an NUnit project.
   
<h4>Command Line</h4>

<p>Assembly Isolation may be specified on the console runner commandline using
   the <b>/process</b> and <b>/domain</b> options. See 
    nunit_doc_link("consoleCommandLine", "NUnit-Console Command Line Options")
   for more information.
   
<h4>General Settings</h4>

<p>The built-in NUnit defaults may be overridden using the <b>Assembly Isolation</b>
   panel of the NUnit <b>Settings Dialog</b>. Settings made here are saved and become
   the new default values for all executions of NUnit until changed. For more info,
   see the  nunit_doc_link("settingsDialog", "Settings Dialog") page.

<h4>Project Settings</h4>

<p>Isolation settings may be specified for an individual NUnit project using the
    nunit_doc_link("projectEditor", "Project Editor").
