<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>Nunit provides three different runners, which may be used to load and
run your tests.

<ul>
<li>The  nunit_doc_link( "nunit-console", "console runner" ), 
    nunit-console.exe, is used for batch execution.
<li>The  nunit_doc_link( "nunit-gui", "gui runner" ), nunit.exe,
    provides interactive loading and running of tests.
<li>The  nunit_doc_link( "pnunit", "pNUnit runner" ), 
    pnunit-launcher.exe, is used to run parallel, distributed tests under the
	control of pNUnit.
</ul>

<h3>Third-Party Runners</h3>

<p>Various third-party applications are available for loading and running
   NUnit tests. Some of these actually use NUnit to load the tests, while
   others provide their own emulation and may not work in the same way 
   that NUnit does.
   
<p>Because the status of such projects may change from time to time, we don't
   discuss them individually here. For the latest information, consult the 
   manufacturer of any third-party software or ask other users on our
   <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nunit-discuss">discussion list</a>.
