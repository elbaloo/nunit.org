<h3>DatapointAttribute / DatapointsAttribute (NUnit 2.5) (Experimental)</h3>

<p>The <b>Datapoint</b> and <b>Datapoints</b> attributes are used
   to provide data for <b>Theories</b> and are ignored for ordinary
   tests - including tests with parameters.
   
<p>When a Theory is loaded, NUnit creates arguments for each
   of its parameters by using any fields of the same type
   as the parameter annotated with the <b>DatapointAttribute</b>.
   In addition, elements of arrays of the required type
   annotated with the <b>DatapointsAttribute</b> are also used.
   
<p><b>Note:</b> In the current release, these attributes are only recognized
   when used exactly as specified above. In particular, they may not be used
   on methods or properties and the <b>DatapointsAttribute</b> may only be
   placed on an array. These limitations will be removed in a later release.
   
<h4>Automatically Supplied Datapoints</h4>

<p>It is normally not necessary to specify datapoints for 
   <b>boolean</b> or <b>enum</b> arguments. Beginning with
   version 2.5.4, NUnit automatically supplies values of <b>true</b> 
   and <b>false</b> for <b>boolean</b> arguments and will supply all 
   defined values of any enumeration.
   
<p>If for some reason you don't wish to use all possible values, you
   can override this behavior by supplying your own datapoints. If you
   supply any datapoints for an argument, automatic datapoint generation 
   is suppressed.
