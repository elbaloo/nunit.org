<h3>NUnit 2.5.4 - Version 2.5.4.10098 - April 8, 2010</h3>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now defaults to running an assembly under the runtime version for
which it was built. If that version is not available, a higher version may be
used. See the <?php echo nunit_doc_link( "runtimeSelection", "Runtime Selection" ); ?> 
page for details.
<li><b>ProjectEditor</b> now provides a 'Default' selection for the runtime
version to be used.
<li>The XML result file format has been enhanced to provide additional information
needed to identify and report on theories and also includes extended result states
such as Inconclusive, Invalid, Error and Cancelled.
<li>The <b>EmptyConstraint</b> (Is.Empty) may now be used with a <b>DirectoryInfo</b>
to test whether the directory is empty.
<li>Datapoints for <b>boolean</b> and <b>enum</b> arguments are now generated 
automatically for theories.
<li>The cache path for shadow copying is now saved in the NUnit settings file
rather than in the config files. The settings dialog may be used to change it
if necessary.
</ul>
