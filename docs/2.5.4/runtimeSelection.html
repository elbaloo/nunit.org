<h3>Runtime Selection</h3>

<p>Before loading an assembly, NUnit must determine what runtime to use. By default
(see below for exceptions) the following rules are used:

<ol>
<li><p>If the assembly was built for the same runtime under which NUnit is currently 
running, then that runtime is used.

<li><p>If the assembly was built for a different runtime version and that version 
is available, NUnit uses it, running out of process if necessary. 

<li><p>If the assembly was built for a different runtime version, which is not
available, then the result depends on whether the build version is earlier or
later than the current version. If earlier, the test will be run using the
same runtime version under which NUnit is running. If later, then it is not
possible to load the test and NUnit gives an error message.

<li><p>If multiple assemblies are being run at the same time, NUnit first
determines the runtime under which each assembly was built. The highest version 
is then selected for the entire group, and rules 1 through 3 are applied.
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> For versions 2.5.4 and 2.5.5, automatic runtime selection only
works in the Gui runner. Use the /framework option to select the appropriate
runtime under the Console runner.

<h3>Overriding the Defaults</h3>

<p>The default runtime framework may be overridden using command line arguments, 
   menu items in the Gui or settings in an NUnit project file. Provided that the 
   requested framework is available, it will be used. If it isn't available, 
   NUnit will issue an error message.
   
<p><b>Note:</b> To use version 1.x runtimes, you must have NUnit's support 
   for those runtimes installed, in addition to the runtime itself. This
   support is an option of the NUnit installation.

<h4>Command Line Options</h4>

<p>The <b>/framework</b> option of console runner allows you to specify
   the framework type and version to be used for a test run. See
    nunit_doc_link("consoleCommandLine", "NUnit-Console Command Line Options")
   for more information.
   
<h4>Gui Menu Selection</h4>

<p>The main menu provides <b>File | Select Runtime</b> sub-items allowing you
   to reload the tests under a specific runtime. See 
    nunit_doc_link("mainMenu", "Main Menu") for more info.
   
<h4>Project Settings</h4>

<p>The NUnit project format supports specification of a specific runtime to
   be used with a project at the configuration level. See
    nunit_doc_link("projectEditor", "Project Editor")
   for more information.
