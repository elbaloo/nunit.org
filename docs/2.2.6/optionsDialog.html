<h3>Display Tab</h3>

<h4>Recent Files</h4>

<p>The text box allows the user to choose the number of entries to display in the recent files list.
If <b>Load most recent project at startup</b> is checked, the GUI will load the last file opened unless it
is run with a specific filename or with the <code>/noload</code> parameter.</p>

<h4>Tree View</h4>
<p>The list box allows selecting the degree of expansion of the tree when tests are loaded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Expand</b> – expands all tests</p>
<p><b>Collapse</b> – collapses all tests</p>
<p><b>Hide Tests</b> – expands all suites except for the fixtures themselves.</p>
<p><b>Auto</b> – selects one of the above based on the space available for the tree display.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <b>Clear results when reloading</b> is checked, an automatic or manual reload will reinitialize all
test nodes in the tree (grey display) – if it is not checked, result information for tests that do
not seem to have changed will be retained.</p>

<h4>Test Output</h4>

<p>Check <b>Label Test Cases in Console output</b> to precede text in the output window with the name of the test that produced it.</p>

<p>Check <b>Display Failure ToolTips</b> to display the tip window over the
Errors and Failures display and the stack trace. Clear it if you prefer not
to see the tip window.</p>

<h3>Tests Tab</h3>

<h4>Assembly Reload</h4>

<p>If <b>Reload before each test run</b> is checked, a reload will occur whenever the run button is
pressed whether the assemblies appear to have changed or not.</p>

<p>If <b>Reload when test assembly changes</b> is checked, assemblies are watched for any change and
an automatic reload is initiated. This item is disabled on Windows 98 or ME.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio</h3>

<p>If <b>Enable Visual Studio Support</b> is checked, the user will be able to open Visual Studio projects
and solutions and add Visual Studio projects to existing test projects.</p>
