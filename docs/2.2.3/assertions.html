<h2>Assertions</h2>

<p>Assertions are central to unit testing in any of the xUnit frameworks, and NUnit 
	is no exception. NUnit provides a rich set of assertions as static methods of 
	the Assert class.</p>

<p>If an assertion fails, the method call does not return and an error is reported. 
	If a test contains multiple assertions, any that follow the one that failed 
	will not be executed. For this reason, it's usually best to try for one 
	assertion per test.</p>

<p>Each method may be called without a message, with a simple text message or with 
	a message and arguments. In the last case the message is formatted using the 
	provided text and arguments.</p>

<p>The Assert class provides the most commonly used assertions. It provides
   For convenience of presentation, we group Assert methods as follows:
   <ul>
     <li><?php echo nunit_doc_link( "equalityAsserts", "Equality Asserts" ) ?>
     <li><?php echo nunit_doc_link( "identityAsserts", "Identity Asserts" ) ?>
     <li><?php echo nunit_doc_link( "typeAsserts", "Type Asserts" ) ?>
 	 <li><?php echo nunit_doc_link( "conditionAsserts", "Condition tests" ) ?>
	 <li><?php echo nunit_doc_link( "utilityAsserts", "Utility methods" ) ?>.</ul></p>
 
<p>Additional assertions on strings are provided by the 
	<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "stringAssert", "StringAssert" ) ?> class.</p>
