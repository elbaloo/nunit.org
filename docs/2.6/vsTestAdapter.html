<h2>NUnit Test Adapter for Visual Studio 11</h2>

<p>The NUnit Test Adapter allows you to run NUnit tests inside
   Visual Studio. The current release, version 0.92, is designed to work
   with the Visual Studio 11 Beta Release. Releases of Visual Studio
   prior to VS 11 did not have the ability to directly run tests built with 
   Open Source testing frameworks like NUnit.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The easiest way to install the NUnit Test Adapter is using the
   Extension Manager within Visual Studio. Follow these steps:
   <ol>
   <li>From within Visual Studio 11, select Tools | Extension Manager.
   <li>In the left panel of the Extension Manager, select Online Extensions.
   <li>Locate the NUnit Test Adapter in the center panel and highlight it.
   <li>Click 'Download' and follow the instructions.
   </ol>

<p>Use the Extension Manager to ensure that the NUnit Test Adapter is enabled.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>In preparation for using the test adapter, make sure that the Unit
   Test Explorer is shown in your window. If you don't see it, use
   the menu ( <b>Unit Test | Windows | Unit Test Explorer</b> ) to show it and position
   the window where you would like it within Visual Studio.

    nunit_doc_img( "nunitTestAdapter.png" )
</div>

<p>When you initially open a solution, no tests will be displayed.
   After compiling the assemblies in the solution, Visual Studio will
   interact with the NUnit Test Adapter to discover tests and a list 
   of them will be shown in the Unit Test Explorer.

<p>Click on <b>Run All Tests</b> in the Unit Test Explorer to run 
   all the tests. You may also select one or more tests in the list and 
   run them by right-clicking and using the context menu.

<p>The context menu also contains entries for debugging tests and for
   navigating to the source code of a test.

<h3>Known Problems</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no test status corresponding to NUnit's <b>Inconclusive</b>
    result, so tests with this result are reported as <b>Not Run</b>.

<li><p>Test cases appear in a flat list, without any grouping by fixture or
    namespace. This can make it hard to select a group of related tests 
    to be run. It is, however, relatively easy to rerun all failing tests.

<li><p>Theories are reported as individual cases, rather as a single unit.

<li><p>Startup performance is now improved as compared to the developer 
    preview, but is still intermittently slow.
</ol>

<h3>Reporting Problems</h3>

<p>Bugs should be reported using the separate test adapter
