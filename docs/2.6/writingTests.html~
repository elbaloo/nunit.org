<h2>Writing Tests</h2>

<p>NUnit tests may be written using any .NET language that supports attributes.

<p><?php echo nunit_doc_link("attributes", "Attributes") ?> are used to indicate
   test classes and methods and to modify their behavior in various ways.

<p><?php echo nunit_doc_link("assertions", Assertions) ?> test an actual value
   against one or more <?php echo nunit_doc_link("constraintModel", "Constraints") ?>
   and result in either a successful test or a failure.

<p>User code may acquire information about the test and it's environment by
   use of the <?php echo nunit_doc_link("testContext", "Test&nbsp;Context") ?>.
