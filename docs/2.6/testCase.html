<h3>TestCaseAttribute (NUnit 2.5)</h3>

<p><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> serves the dual purpose of marking a method with
   parameters as a test method and providing inline data to be used when
   invoking that method. Here is an example of a test being run three
   times, with three different sets of data:
   
<div class="code">
<pre>[TestCase(12,3,4)]
[TestCase(12,2,6)]
[TestCase(12,4,3)]
public void DivideTest(int n, int d, int q)
{
  Assert.AreEqual( q, n / d );
}
</pre>
</div>

<p><b>Note:</b> Because arguments to .NET attributes are limited in terms of the 
Types that may be used, NUnit will make some attempt to convert the supplied
values using <b>Convert.ChangeType()</b> before supplying it to the test.

<p><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> may appear one or more times on a test method,
which may also carry other attributes providing test data, such as the
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "factories", "FactoriesAttribute" ) ?>.
The method may optionally be marked with the 
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "test", "TestAttribute" ) ?> as well.

<p>By using the named parameter <b>Result</b> this test set may be simplified
further:

<div class="code">
<pre>[TestCase(12,3, Result=4)]
[TestCase(12,2, Result=6)]
[TestCase(12,4, Result=3)]
public int DivideTest(int n, int d)
{
  return( n / d );
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>In the above example, NUnit checks that the return
value of the method is equal to the expected result provided on the attribut

<p><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> supports a number of additional 
named parameters, which may be used as follows:

<dl>
<dt><b>Description</b>
<dd>Sets the description property of the test
<dt><b>ExpectedException</b>
<dd>Specifies a the Type of an exception that should be thrown by this invocation
<dt><b>ExpectedExceptionName</b>
<dd>Specifies a the FullName of an exception that should be thrown by this invocation
<dt><b>ExpectedMessage</b>
<dd>Specifies the message text of the expected exception
<dt><b>Explicit</b>
<dd>Set to true in order to make the individual test case Explicit. Use <b>Reason</b> to explain why.
<dt><b>Ignore</b>
<dd>Set to true in order to ignore the individual test case. Use <b>Reason</b> to explain why.
<dt><b>IgnoreReason</b>
<dd>Causes this test case to be ignored and specifies the reason. Equivalent to <b>Ignore</b> combined with <b>Reason</b>. This attribute will be removed in a later release.
<dt><b>MatchType</b>
<dd>A <b>MessageMatch</b> enum value indicating how to test the expected message (See <?php echo nunit_doc_link("exception", "ExpectedExceptionAttribute") ?>)
<dt><b>Reason</b>
<dd>Specifies the reason for not running this test case. Use in conjunction with <b>Ignore</b> or <b>Explicit</b>.
<dt><b>Result</b>
<dd>The expected result to be returned from the method, which must have
a compatible return type.
<dt><b>TestName</b>
<dd>Provides a name for the test. If not specified, a name is generated based on 
the method name and the arguments provided.
</dl>

<h3>Order of Execution</h3>

<p>In NUnit 2.5, individual test cases are sorted alphabetically and executed in
   that order. Beginning with NUnit 2.5.1, the individual cases are not sorted, but are
   executed in the order in which NUnit discovers them. This order does <b>not</b>
   follow the lexical order of the attributes and will often vary between different
   compilers or different versions of the CLR.
   
<p>As a result, when <b>TestCaseAttribute</b> appears multiple times on a method
   or when other data-providing attributes are used in combination with 
   <b>TestCaseAttribute</b>, the order of the test cases is undefined.
