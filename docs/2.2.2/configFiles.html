<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

<p>NUnit uses configuration files for the test runner executable – either nunit-console.exe or
nunitgui.exe – as well as for the tests being run. Only settings that pertain to NUnit itself should be in
the nunit-console.exe.config and nunit-gui.exe.config, while those that pertain to your own
application and tests should be in a separate configuration file.</p>

<h3>NUnit Configuration Files</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the nunit-console and nunit-gui config files is to allow NUnit to run with
various versions of the .NET framework. NUnit 2.2 is built using version 1.1 of the framework,
but can be made to run against version 1.0 or 2.0. As delivered, the config file selects the first
installed version of .NET it finds in this order: 1.1, 2.0, 1.0. You should edit the config files if you
prefer a different order. Your tests will run using the same version of the framework that is used
to run NUnit itself.</p>

<h3>Test Configuration File</h3>

<p>When a configuration file is used to provide settings or to control the environment in which a test
is run, specific naming conventions must be followed.</p>

<p>If a single assembly is being loaded, then the configuration file is given the name of the assembly
file with the config extension. For example, the configuration file used to run nunit.tests.dll must
be named nunit.tests.dll.config and located in the same directory as the dll.</p>

<p>If an NUnit project is being loaded, the configuration file uses the name of the project file with
the extension <i>changed</i> to config. For example, the project AllTests.nunit would require a
configuration file named AllTests.config, located in the same directory as AllTests.nunit. The
same rule is followed when loading Visual Studio projects or solutions.</p>

<p>Generally, you should be able to simply copy your application config file and rename it as
described above. However, see the next section if you wish to run tests compiled for an earlier
version of NUnit.</p>
