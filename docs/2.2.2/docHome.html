<h2>NUnit 2.2.2</h2>
	
<p>This documentation has been updated to reflect changes made in version 2.2.2 of NUnit. Where applicable, we have 
	marked sections with the version in which a feature first appeared.</p>

<p>If you are new to NUnit, we suggest you begin by reading the 
	<a href="getStarted.html">Getting Started</a> section of this site.
	 Those who have used earlier releases may want to begin with the 
	<a href="upgrade.html">Upgrading</a> section.</p>

<p>NUnit 2.2 was the first release of NUnit, for which the documentation was packaged 
	in HTML format.  At the time of its release, some documentation had not yet been
      converted and was provided in a supplementary PDF file. The documentation on this 
      site has been reorganized from that included in the NUnit 2.2 distribution. All
      documentation is now included in the site.</p>
