<h2>RepeatAttribute (NUnit 2.5)</h2>

<h2>Not yet supported in NUnit 2.9.6</h2>

<p><b>RepeatAttribute</b> is used on a test method to specify that it should be
   executed multiple times. If any repetition fails, the remaining ones are
   not run and a failure is reported.

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>It is not currently possible to use RepeatAttribute on a TestFixture
    or any other type of test suite. Only single tests may be repeated.
<li>Since a parameterized test method represents a suite, RepeatAttribute
    is ignored when it appears on such a method.
</ol>
