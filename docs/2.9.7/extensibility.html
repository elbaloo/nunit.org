<h2>NUnit Extensibility</h2>

<p>NUnit is designed to be extended in a number of ways.</p>

<p>Extensions to the NUnit framework - the part of NUnit that is referenced
by tests - usually take the form of 
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "customConstraints", "Custom Constraints" ) ?> or
<?php echo nunit_doc_link( "customAttributes", "Custom Attributes" ) ?>, written by users to 
encapsulate tests that pertain to their specific projects.</p>

<p>Through version 2.6.2, NUnit also supported an <b>Addin</b> mechanism, which
could be used to extend NUnit. This is not currently supported in NUnit 2.9.6.

<p>We are evaluating additional extension approaches for use in NUnit 3.0 and may
re-introduce the use of <b>Addins</b> or use a plugin mechanism of somewhat 
different design.
