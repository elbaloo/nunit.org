<h3>NUnit 2.4.3 - August 16, 2007</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mono compatibility is significantly improved. The Gui runs under Mono
1.2.2. A number of tests, which were previously skipped under Mono, are now 
executed successfully. See the 
<a href="http://nunit.com/index.php?p=platformSupport">Platform Support</a>
page on the website for more information.

<li>Documentation is now available as a separate download.
</ul>

<h4>Console Runner</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console runner now uses negative return codes for errors encountered
in trying to run the test.
Failures or errors in the test themselves give a positive return 
code equal to the number of such failures or errors.

</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Comparisons between numeric values of various types now work correctly (see note).

<li>Fixed crashing problems running the Gui under .NET 1.0. and Mono.

<li>Fixed several problems when the new Load Fixture facility of the Gui:
  <ul>
    <li>An exception is no longer thrown when using it with multiple AppDomains.
	<li>The Load Fixture menu item is no longer enabled for the top-level node.
	<li>Assemblies within a test project now load without error.
	<li>The full namespace hierarchy is now shown when loading a TestFixture.
  </ul>
  
<li>Fixed incorrect implementation of CollectionAssert.AreEquivalent and
CollectionAssert.IsEqualTo so that the number of occurences of an object
in a collection is properly taken into account (see note). 
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> Several of these fixes may cause failures of tests, which 
had appeared to pass. In most cases, the passing tests were probably
false positives.

</ul>
