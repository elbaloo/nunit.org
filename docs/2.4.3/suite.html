<h3>SuiteAttribute (NUnit 2.0)</h3>
	
<p>The Suite Attribute is used to define subsets of suites based on user 
	preference. It was introduced in NUnit 2.0 to replace inheritance from
	the TestSuite class.</p>
	
<p>Originally, the NUnit developers believed that the need for the Suite
    mechanism would diminish because of the dynamic creation of suites based
	on namespaces. It was provided for backwards compatibility.</p>
	
<p>That has not proven to be true. Suites are still used today by many people,
    so we are making an effort to revive them in terms of usability. The 
	current release supports suites using the classic mechanism: a static property
	with the SuiteAttribute returns a TestSuite, populated with the tests
	that are to be executed.
	
<p>This approach currently has some limitations, which we hope to remove in
    a future NUnit release:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Creating a suite requires a reference to the nunit.core assembly,
		which is not normally referenced by user tests. This means that the tests
		can not be ported across versions of NUnit without recompilation.
		<p>
		<li>There is currently no easy way to run user-defined suites as a part
		of a larger run. They were originally intended as a way to define a
		set of tests at the top level and so can only be used by specifying them
		on the command-line with the /fixture option.
	</ol>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<div class="code"><pre class="prettyprint">namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;
  using NUnit.Core;

  public class AllTests
  {
    [Suite]
    public static TestSuite Suite
    {
      get
      {
        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("All Tests");
        suite.Add(new OneTestCase());
        suite.Add(new Assemblies.AssemblyTests());
        suite.Add(new AssertionTest());
        return suite;
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

</div>
