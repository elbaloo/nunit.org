<h2>NUnit-Console</h2>
<p>The nunit-console.exe program is a text-based runner and can be used when you 
	want to run all your tests and don&#146;t need a red/yellow/green indication of 
	success or failure.</p>
<p>It is useful for automation of tests and integration into other systems. It 
	automatically saves its results in XML format, allowing you to produce reports 
	or otherwise process the results. The following is a screenshot of the console 
	program.</p>

<p>
<p>In this example, nunit-console has just run the tests in the mock-assembly.dll 
	that is part of the NUnit distribution. This assembly contains a number of tests, some
	of which are either ignored or marked explicit. The summary line shows the
	result of the test run. Click  nunit_doc_file( "TestResult.xml", "here" ) 
	to see the XML produced for this test run.</p>
	
<p>The .NET 2.0 version of the nunit-console program is built using /platform:anycpu,
which causes it to be jit-compiled to 32-bit code on a 32-bit system and 64-bit code 
on a 64 bit system. This causes an exception when NUnit is used to test a 32-bit
application on a 64-bit system. To avoid this problem, use the nunit-console-x86 
program, which is built using /platform:x86, when testing 32-bit code on a 
64-bit system.
