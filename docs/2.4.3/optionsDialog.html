<h2>Options Dialog</h2>

<p>The Options Dialog is displayed using the Tools | Options menu item and allows the user to
control some aspects of NUnit’s operation.</p>

<hr><h3>General Options</h3><hr>

<h3>Recent Files</h3>

<p>The text box allows the user to choose the number of entries to display in the recent files list.
If <b>Load most recent project at startup</b> is checked, the GUI will load the last file opened unless it
is run with a specific filename or with the <code>/noload</code> parameter.</p>

   <?php echo nunit_doc_img( "generalOptions.jpg" ) ?>
</div>

<h3>Tree View</h3>

<p>The list box allows selecting the degree of expansion of the tree when tests are loaded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Expand</b> – expands all tests</p>
<p><b>Collapse</b> – collapses all tests</p>
<p><b>Hide Tests</b> – expands all suites except for the fixtures themselves.</p>
<p><b>Auto</b> – selects one of the above based on the space available for the tree display.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <b>Clear results when reloading</b> is checked, an automatic or manual reload will reinitialize all
test nodes in the tree (grey display) – if it is not checked, result information for tests that do
not seem to have changed will be retained.</p>

<p>If <b>Save visual state of each project</b> is checked, NUnit saves the state of the tree
and restores it when the project is next opened. The information saved includes which
branches of the tree are expanded, the selected node, any checked nodes and any
category selection.

<h3>Visual Studio</h3>

<p>If <b>Enable Visual Studio Support</b> is checked, the user will be able to open Visual Studio projects
and solutions and add Visual Studio projects to existing test projects.</p>

<h3>Shadow Copy</h3>

<p>NUnit normally uses .Net shadow-copying in order to allow you to edit
and recompile assemblies while it is running. Uncheck this box to disable
shadow-copy only if you have a particular problem that requires it.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you are tempted to disable shadow copy in order to access
files in the same directory as your assembly, you should be aware that there
are alternatives. Consider using the Assembly.Codebase property rather than
Assembly.Location.

<hr><h3>Test Load Options</h3><hr>

<h3>Test Structure</h3>

<p>If <b>Automatic Namespace suites</b> is selected, tests will be
   shown in a hierarchical listing based on namespaces. This is the
   standard display as used in versions prior to NUnit 2.4.

<p>If <b>Flat list of TestFixtures</b> is selected, tests will be
   shown as a sequential list of fixtures.

<div class="screenshot-right">
   <?php echo nunit_doc_img( "testLoadOptions.jpg" ) ?>
</div>

<h3>Multiple Assemblies</h3>

<p>If <b>Load in separate AppDomains</b> is selected, each assembly
   in a multiple-assembly test run will be loaded in a separate AppDomain.

<p>If <b>Load in a single AppDomain</b> is selected, all assemblies in
   a multiple-assembly test run will use the same AppDomain. This is
   the standard behavior of NUnit prior to version 2.4.

<p>If <b>Merge tests across assemblies</b> is checked, the display of tests
   will not be divided across assemblies. If automatic namespace suites are
   used, they will be merged across all assemblies. This option is only
   available when tests are run in the same appdomain.

<h3>Assembly Reload</h3>

<p>If <b>Reload before each test run</b> is checked, a reload will occur whenever the run button is
pressed whether the assemblies appear to have changed or not.</p>

<p>If <b>Reload when test assembly changes</b> is checked, assemblies are watched for any change and
an automatic reload is initiated. This item is disabled on Windows 98 or ME.</p>

<p>If <b>Re-run tests automatically</b> is checked, tests are re-run whenever a Reload
   takes place.</p>
   
<hr><h3>Test Output Options</h3><hr>

<h3>Test Results</h3>

<p>Check <b>Display Errors and Failures</b> to display the 
<b>Errors and Failures</b> tab, which shows information about failing tests.

<p>Check <b>Display Failure ToolTips</b> to display the tip window over the
Errors and Failures display and the stack trace. Clear it if you prefer not
to see the tip window.</p>

<div class="screenshot-right">
   <?php echo nunit_doc_img( "testOutputOptions.jpg" ) ?>
</div>

<p>Check <b>Enable Word Wrap in Error Display</b> to turn on word wrapping
in the Errors and Failures display. While you can select this item and the
preceding one at the same time, they do not interact well, so you will 
normally choose one or the other.</p>

<p>Check <b>Display Tests Not Run</b> to display the 
<b>Tests Not Run</b> tab, which shows information about tests that were
skipped or ignored.

<h3>Test Output</h3>

<p>Check <b>Display Console Standard Output</b> to display the 
<b>Console.Out</b> tab, which shows text written to the Console by your tests.

<p>Check <b>Label Test Cases</b> to precede text in the output window with the 
name of the test that produced it.</p>

<p>Check <b>Display Console Error Output</b> to display text written to
Console.Error by your tests.

<p>Select <b>In Separate Tab</b> to show error output in the <b>Console.Error</b> tab.
<p>Select <b>Merge with Console Output</b> to hide the <b>Console.Error</b> tab
and display error output in the <b>Console.Out</b> tab.

<p>Check <b>Display Trace Output</b> to display trace output written by your tests.
 
<p>Select <b>In Separate Tab</b> to show trace output in the <b>Trace Output</b> tab.
<p>Select <b>Merge with Console Output</b> to hide the <b>Trace Output</b> tab
and display trace output in the <b>Console.Out</b> tab.
