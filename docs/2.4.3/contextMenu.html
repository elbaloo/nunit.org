<h4>Run</h4>

<p>Runs all the tests.</p>

<h4>Run Failed</h4>
<p>Runs only the tests that failed on the previous run.</p>

   be used to select multiple tests for running.</p>
   
<h4>Expand</h4>
<p>Expands the selected test node – invisible if the node is expanded or has no children.</p>

<h4>Collapse</h4>
<p>Collapses the selected test node – invisible if the node is collapsed or has no children.</p>

<h4>Expand All</h4>
<p>Expands all nodes of the tree.</p>
