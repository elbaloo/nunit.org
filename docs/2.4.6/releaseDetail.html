<h3>NUnit 2.4.6 - December 31, 2007</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>CollectionAssert</b> has been modified to work with instances
of <b>IEnumerable</b> even if they are not true collections.
<li>All attributes are now unsealed and attributes that derive
from them will now be recognized by NUnit. For example, if you
derive SpecAttribute from TestAttribute, you may use [Spec] to
designate test methods without writing an extension. Note that
you will still need to create an extension if you want to
introduce any new behavior.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The new <b>/run</b> commandline option may be used to execute any
test method, class or namespace. Unlike the <b>/fixture</b> option,
it does not restrict classes that are loaded into memory so
it works properly with assemblies containing <b>SetUpFixture</b>.
This option should generally be preferred to the <b>/fixture</b>
option for new work.
<li>The console runner now allows combining categories through
use of boolean expressions. For example, <b>/include:Long+Data</b> 
will run all tests that have both of the categories Long and Data
applied to them.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>When a test run has errors, the first one is now automatically selected
at the end of the run.
<li>Error messages have been reformatted so that the user message or expected
value display starts a new line.
<li>Extra leadin spaces have been removed from the stack trace display.
<li>A new command-line option <b>/runselected</b> causes the gui to run the last
remembered test selection. If no selection information has been saved for
the project, then all tests are run.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The NUnit web site now includes a <a href="http://nunit.com/?p=extensions">directory</a> 
of published extensions to NUnit. The initial release of the site includes
only a few items but will continue to expand as we receive and review extensions
from contributors.

</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit-console now shows a stack trace when the TestFixtureSetUp fails or
if the fixture constructor throws an exception.
<li>The Enable Shadow Copy checkbox in the options dialog now functions
correctly.
<li>Automatic rerun no longer takes place when a run is already in progress.
<li>Logging is commented out in the config file since the entries must
be tailored for certain installations to avoid exceptions.
<li>Non-assembly files in the addins directory no longer cause the
loading of addins to fail.
<li>The selection of Mini versus Full Gui displays in the options dialog
now works correctly.
<li>The status bar is no longer displayed for the Mini Gui.
<li>Help text, which was formerly available in the options dialog,
has now been restored.
</ul>
