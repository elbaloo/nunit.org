<h3>NUnit 2.4.2 - August 2, 2007</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>The .Net 2.0 packages now include nunit-x86.exe and nunit-console-x86.exe,
which may be used to test 32-bit code on 64-bit systems.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>Numeric comparison is now performed by converting the expected and actual
values to the widest of the two types rather than by comparing the string
representation of the two values. This eliminates certain problems with 
decimals and floats and is more representative of how the comparison would
be performed in most programming languages.

<li>Two new attributes allow tailoring the tests for different cultures
   <dl style="margin-left: 2em">
      <dt>CultureAttribute
	  <dd>Allows you to specify the cultures under which a test should be
	  run or skipped. It works just like PlatformAttribute, supporting named
	  parameters Include, Exclude and Reason. You can use local cultures ("en-GB")
	  or neutral cultures ("en"). It may be used on tests, fixtures or assemblies.
	  <dt>SetCultureAttribute
	  <dd>Changes the culture for the duration of the test. As of this release,
	  only a single culture may be specified, so you will need to create a separate
	  test method for each culture under which you want ta test to be run.
   </dl>
   
<li>Expected and actual value messages created by NUnit now use the InvariantCulture
in formatting numeric values. DateTime values are formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff".

<li>A number of changes have been made to the constraint-based Assert syntax
introduced in version 2.4:
  <dl style="margin-left: 2em">
    <dt>EqualTo(...).Within(...)
    <dd>A tolerance may be specified 
    for any numeric type and works as expected. The value specified as a tolerance
    must be convertible to the type used in the comparison or an exception will
    be thrown.

    <dt>Collection Asserts 
    <dd>Asserts that require a collection as the actual value now throw an exception
    if the value is not a collection. In earlier releases, the test failed, which
    caused false positives when it was modified by Not.
	
	<dt>Syntax Helpers
	<dd>NUnit 2.4.1 provided four SyntaxHelpers: Is, List, Text and the 
	undocumented Has helper. In 2.4.2, there are three helpers, with the List
	class now being used for mapping collections as describe below.
	
	Rather than inheriting from a common base containing properties like Not and
	All, each SyntaxHelper now implements only specific properties.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is</b> defines the large majority of constraint tests. Since it is
	a keyword in Visual Basic, the synonym <b>Iz</b> is provided for VB users.
	Constraint operators <b>Is.All</b> and <b>Is.Not</b> are supported.
	<li><b>Text</b> defines constraints that are specific to strings.
	Constraint operator <b>Is.All</b> is supported as well.
	<li><b>Has</b> is newly documented and extended in 2.4.2. It is used to make
	tests on members of collections, elements of arrays, entries in dictionaries
	and properties of objects. Operators <b>Has.No</b>, <b>Has.All</b>,
	<b>Has.Some</b> and <b>Has.None</b> are supported.
	<li><b>List.Contains()</b> has been replaced by <b>Has.Member()</b>.
	</ul>

	<dt>List.Map
	<dd>Used to map a collection provided as an actual value to another collection
	to which constraints are then applied. Currently supports creating a list
	of the values of a given property. See the documentation for details.
  </dl>
  
  <li>The <b>IConstraint</b> interface has been removed. Custom constraint
  classes should inherit from the <b>Constraint</b> abstract class. 

</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When tests in an NUnit project are run in multiple AppDomains, any non-default
  values set for AppBase, PrivateBinPath and Configuration File are now honored for 
  each separate assembly. If values are not provided, the default is to use the
  location of each assembly together with any config file with the name of the
  assembly plus the ".config" extension. When running in a single AppDomain, the
  existing defaults are unchanged.
  
  <li>Any changes to the current directory or current culture made during a test 
  are now restored at the end of the test. For example, if you set the culture
  with code in your TestFixtureSetUp, that change will remain in place until
  all tests are run and the TestFixtureTearDown completes. At that point, the
  value will be restored to what it was before.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The main window is activated whenever a test run has failures. This causes
NUnit's taskbar button to be highlighted if the window is minimized or hidden.

<li>The reload menu item is now called Reload Tests. It continues to work as 
before, causing any changes in the assemblies to be merged into the tree. A new
menu item, Reload Project, does a complete load by closing the project and 
reopening it as if the user had done so through the Open menu item.

<li>Separate recent file lists are maintained, one for running under .NET 2.0
and one for earlier versions of the runtime. This useful for developers who work
on multiple projects as well as those who maintain configurations for different
runtimes in the same project file.

<li>The tree context menu contains an entry to load the selected fixture alone.
Developers working on large projects can reduce reloading time significantly
by using this feature to load only a subset of the tests. A separate context
menu item is used to reload the full project.

<b>Note:</b> This feature is a quick and dirty solution to the problem 
of reload time. It is limited to a single selected item because that's
what the underlying test loader currently supports. Future releases will
deal with this in an entirely different way.

<li>The Gui can now save and restore the visual state of the tree when a 
project is closed and restores it on open. The following items are saved:
  <ul>
  <li>Whether checkboxes are shown
  <li>The topmost visible node
  <li>The selected node
  <li>Which nodes are expanded or collapsed
  <li>Which nodes are checked
  <li>Which categories are selected
  </ul>
This is controlled by a selection on the Options Dialog.
  
<b>Note:</b> TopNode is restored correctly under .NET 2.0. Under .NET 1.1
the node is made visible but may not be at the top of the display.

<li>A summary of the last test run is shown below the progress bar. This
information remains displayed even when the information in the status
bar changes.

<li>The Gui now remembers the last result tab selected.

<li>The Project Editor now displays a confirmation box when you attempt
to delete an assembly from the project.

<li>If you change settings in the Options Dialog, which require a reload
in order to take effect, a message box gives you the opportunity to 
reload the project immediately.

<li>If you change the active configuration - as from Debug to Release - and
the new config can not be loaded, the old configuration is unloaded. In prior
releases, the old config remained loaded even though the new config was
marked as active.

<li>The "Reloading..." message is now displayed when automatic reloading
takes place.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

</ul>
