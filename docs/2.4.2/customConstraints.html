<h2>Custom Constraints (NUnit 2.4)</h2>

<p>You can implement your own custom constraints by creating a class that 
inherits from the <b>Constraint</b> abstract class, which supports performing a 
test on an actual value and generating appropriate messages. The class includes
two abstract methods, which you must override and two virtual methods which
may be overridden as needed:
   
<div class="code" style="width: 36em">
<pre class="prettyprint">public abstract class Constraint
{
 	...
    public abstract bool Matches( object actual );
    public abstract void WriteDescriptionTo( MessageWriter writer );
    public virtual void WriteMessageTo( MessageWriter writer );
    public virtual void WriteActualValueTo( MessageWriter writer );
	...
}</pre>
</div>   

<p>Your derived class should save the actual argument to Matches in the protected
field actual for later use.

<p>The MessageWriter abstract class is implemented in the framework by
TextMessageWriter. Examining the source for some of the builtin constraints
should give you a good idea of how to use it.
