<h3>NUnit 2.5.2 - Version 2.5.2.9222 - August 10, 2009</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is the last release of NUnit using source code
   maintained on Sourceforge. The CVS repository there will be kept,
   but no longer updated. After this release, the source is being
   maintained on Launchpad at http://launchpad.net/nunit-2.5.

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The new <b>SetUICultureAttribute</b> allows setting CurrentUICulture
    for the duration of a test method, fixture or assembly.
<li>The <b>TestFixture</b>, <b>TestCase</b> and <b>TestCaseData</b> attributes
    have been enhanced to allow ignoring an individual fixture instance or
	test case. Two new named parameters are provided:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Ignore</b> may be set to true to ignore an item.
	<li><b>IgnoreReason</b> may be set to specify the reason for ignoring
	    the item. If IgnoreReason is set to a non-empty string, then setting
		Ignore is optional.
	</ul>
<li><b>Assert.Catch</b> has been added with several overloads. It differs
    from <b>Assert.Throws</b> in accepting exceptions derived from the one
	that is specified. Like <b>Assert.Throws</b>, it returns the exception
	thrown when it succeeds so that further tests can be made on it.
<li>The <b>Throws</b> syntax has a number of new additions:
    <ul>
	<li><b>ThrowsTargetInvocationException</b>, <b>ThrowsArgumentException</b>
	    and <b>Throws.InvalidOperationException</b> provide a shorter syntax
		for testing for these common exception types.
	<li><b>Throws.InnerException</b> applies any constraints to the InnerException 
	    of the exception that was thrown rather than to the exception itself.
	<li><b>InnerException</b> can also be used in constraint expressions - see
	    the documentation for an example.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data from a TestCaseSource in a separate class from the tests
    is now handled correctly.
<li>Arguments specified using TestCaseData are now used correctly.
<li>Comparing the a stream to itself no longer causes an error.
<li>TimeoutAttribute is now permitted on an assembly as documented.
<li>Clear All and Clear Failures buttons are now displayed correctly
    depending on whether Checkboxes are displayed in the Gui.
<li>The console runner option descriptions have been revised to
    more clearly indicate what each option does.
<li>Running special tests that do not use the nunit.framework assembly
    no longer causes a null reference exception.
<li>Console Runner option descriptions have been edited for accuracy.
<li>Gui TreeView now updates correctly when the order of tests has changed.
<li>An exception in TearDown now displays the actual exception
    at the top of the stack rather than a TargetInvocationException.
</ul>
